4,0,"Updated, 9:59 p.m. | Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whose early glow as a
Republican presidential contender was snuffed out with the rise of anti-establishment
rivals, announced Monday that he was quitting the race and urged some of his 15
rivals to do the same so the party could unite against the leading candidate, Donald J.
Trump.
Mr. Walker..È pointed rebuke of Mr. Trump gave powerful voice to the private
fears of many Republicans that the party risked alienating large parts of the electorate
... Hispanics, women, immigrants, veterans, and most recently, Muslims ... if Mr.
Trump continued vilifying or mocking them as part of his overtures to angry and
disaffected voters.
Still, Mr. Walker..È exit was not a selfless sacrifice: He was running low on
campaign cash, sliding sharply in opinion polls, losing potential donors to rivals and
unnerving supporters with a stream of gaffes, like saying he would consider building a
wall along the Canadian border.
Appearing ashen and drained at a brief news conference late Monday in Madison,
Mr. Walker said the Republican presidential field was too focused on ...how bad things
are.. rather than on ...how we can make them better for everyone... Without naming
Mr. Trump, Mr. Walker issued a plea to fellow candidates to coalesce around a
different Republican who could offer a more ...optimistic.. vision and guide the party to
a victory next year that, he admitted with sadness in his voice, he could not achieve
himself.
...Today I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the field in this
race so that a positive, conservative message can rise to the top of the field,.. Mr.
Walker said. ...With this in mind, I will suspend my campaign immediately.
...I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the
same,.. he said, ...so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who
can offer a positive, conservative alternative to the current front-runner...
None of Mr. Walker..È rivals appeared poised to take him up on the suggestion of
bowing out, though they expressed surprise he was withdrawing so soon. ...Holy cow,..
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Fox News.
Mr. Trump, in a Twitter post, was magnanimous: ...I got to know @ScottWalker
well ... he..È a very nice person and has a great future...
Mr. Walker..È departure is likely to have little impact given the sprawling field. He
was competing most aggressively in Iowa, which he deemed a must-win state, but he
had fallen from first place to 10th in a recent poll.
And Mr. Walker..È message ... a tale of conservative triumph over labor unions
and other entrenched Democratic interests in a Midwestern swing state ... plainly
failed to connect. He drew support from less than one-half of 1 percent of Republican
primary voters in a recent CNN national poll.
And while Mr. Walker had built a loyal but small network of major donors,
including wealthy Republicans like Todd Ricketts ... whose father founded TD
Ameritrade ... he was never a force in the Republican race for money, running far
behind rivals like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Mr. Cruz.
If the demise of Mr. Walker..È campaign emphasizes anything, it is the intense
pressure that candidates are under to raise enormous sums of money not only for
their political operations but also for their ...super PACs...
Mr. Bush raised more than $100 million in the first half of 2015, providing him
with enormous resources to compete in a potentially long and costly nomination fight.
Mr. Walker helped raise about $20 million for his super PAC and $6 million more for
a related campaign committee, but Walker advisers were believed to be burning
through cash. (His campaign finances will not be made public until mid-October.)
The need to raise money has had the effect of turning the traditional state-bystate
nomination fights into national contests, in which candidates need to prove
themselves to donors across the country rather than merely win over voters in the
handful of states that hold the earliest caucuses and primaries. Mr. Walker
increasingly tailored his message for Iowans, taking some sharply conservative stands
on issues like immigration and same-sex marriage that posed problems with
moderates.
...In a different era, Governor Walker could have won the nomination if all he had
to worry about was trying to win Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and
Nevada,.. said Matt Moore, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. ...But
now that the presidential race has become so nationalized, so early, a candidate can
run into big trouble if they peak too early and can..È show donors and voters
everywhere that they can recapture momentum...
As recently as this weekend, Mr. Walker was telling supporters like Mr. Ricketts
that he was committed to the race and looking for ways to save money and jump-start
his campaign after a middling performance in Wednesday..È Republican debate. But
advisers said that several factors had been weighing on him for weeks and contributed
to his decision to quit.
Mr. Walker was particularly anxious about accumulating a huge campaign debt
that he would struggle for years to pay off unless he won the Republican nomination.
Compared with Mr. Trump, Carly Fiorina and Mr. Bush, Mr. Walker is a man of
modest means: His father was a preacher and his mother was a part-time secretary,
and he has earned government salaries for most of his adult life. He was not in a
strong position to lend money to his own campaign, advisers said, nor inclined to do
so.
Yet campaign bills were piling up, with some vendors complaining that they had
not been paid on time. Jeff Kaufmann, chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, said
that Mr. Walker was at a disadvantage in a large field of wealthy Republicans who had
personal, family or business connections to wealthy contributors.
...Scott Walker was a lot like the typical American in terms of personal finances ...
he couldn..È write himself a big check,.. Mr. Kaufmann said. ...Nothing eats away at a
candidate from average means like anxieties about massive campaign debts...
Some advisers and donors also complained that Mr. Walker..È campaign manager,
Rick Wiley, had built up a sizable organization in Madison but had devoted too little
money and staffing to crucial field operations. Mr. Wiley did not respond to requests
for comment.
Mr. Walker did start off as a particular favorite of prominent Republicans like the
billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, who both believed that Mr.
Walker was a tough, committed conservative who not only took on fights but also won
them, as shown in his success cutting taxes and hobbling labor unions in Wisconsin.
Yet if Mr. Walker..È record was inspiring, his abilities as a presidential candidate
were ultimately limited. He had verbal slip-ups almost from the start, like saying he
could defeat the Islamic State because he had won the battle against union leaders at
home. And he came across as flat and lacking in sophistication in the televised
debates.
...Scott, for whatever reason, didn..È connect on TV,.. said Stan Hubbard, a
Minnesota-based television station owner and a major Walker donor. ...And if you
can..È make it on television today in national politics, you..Èe dead...
Robert F. List, the former Nevada governor who was chairman of Mr. Walker..È
campaign in the state, said Mr. Walker suffered especially because of the ascent of
charismatic outsider candidates, pointing to Mr. Trump, Mrs. Fiorina and Ben
Carson.
...I attribute the difficulty here to the outsiders sucking up oxygen and diluting the
support for the other candidates,.. Mr. List said. He added that other campaigns had
reached out to solicit his support. ...My phone,.. Mr. List said, ...is ringing...",,,,,,,,24.87,8.35,5.1,3.25,15.08,11.37,5.96,3.09,5.96,2.01,6.96,5.72,0.31,0,0,0,2.86,0,0

5,0,"There will be no more flip jokes about her private email server. There will be no rope lines to
wall off crowds, which added to an impression of aloofness. And there will be new efforts to
bring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious.
Hillary Rodham Clinton declared her campaign for president nearly five months ago, before the
startling rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, the volcanic candidacy of Donald J. Trump and the
very public exploration of another White House run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
In extensive interviews by telephone and at their Brooklyn headquarters last week, Mrs.
Clinton..È strategists acknowledged missteps ... such as their slow response to questions about
her email practices ... and promised that this fall the public would see the sides of Mrs. Clinton
that are often obscured by the noise and distractions of modern campaigning.
They want to show her humor. The self-effacing kind (...The hair is real, the color isn..È,.. she said
of her blond bob recently, taking note of Mr. Trump.) has played better than her sarcastic retorts,
such as when she asked if wiping a computer server was done ...with a cloth...
They want to show her heart, like the time she comforted former drug addicts in a school
meeting room in New Hampshire.
And, to soothe Democrats uneasy about her shaky poll numbers, they want her to relentlessly
contrast herself with Republicans, saying she is at her best when showing willingness to do
battle.
...The true game changer is when there..È a personified opponent,.. said her communications
director, Jennifer Palmieri.
It is not clear whether any of these efforts can help Mrs. Clinton revamp her candidacy and
regain momentum amid persistent questions about her use of a private email server at the State
Department and an electorate in the early nominating states that seems increasingly captivated
by the insurgent candidacy of Mr. Sanders.
Previous attempts to introduce Mrs. Clinton..È softer side to voters have backfired amid criticism
that the efforts seemed overly poll tested. This time the strategy will compete with news
coverage on the latest developments over her email.
...The same force and energy that is giving a lift to Donald Trump is dooming Hillary Clinton, and
that is authenticity,.. said Eric Fehrnstrom, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt
Romney. ...Experience does not matter to them. What matters is you appear genuine...
Several of Mrs. Clinton..È top strategists, speaking from a corner office at the campaign..È
Brooklyn headquarters with shabby mix-and-match chairs andexpansive views of Manhattan,
repeatedly expressed confidence about Mrs. Clinton..È standing, saying that any candidate,
Republican or Democrat, would love to trade places with her. Still, the landscape beyond does
not seem so sunny, with recent polls showing an increasing number of voters do not trust Mrs.
Clinton or believe she understands their problems.
Even as the interview unfolded, one of Mrs. Clinton..È closest advisers, Cheryl D. Mills, prepared
to be questioned by a congressional committee in Washington exploring the 2012 attacks in
Benghazi, Libya.
In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday, 45 percent of Americans said they
had a favorable impression of Mrs. Clinton and 53 percent said they viewed her unfavorably.
That is a weakening since July, when 52 percent had a positive view and 45 percent a negative
one.
Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton..È campaign manager, sought to play down the polls..Èfindings, saying:
...Even if you accept the ABC poll, our favorability is higher than any Republican...È.ÈOther changes are in store for the campaign after Labor Day. After a focus group in New
Hampshire last month revealed that voters wanted to hear directly from Mrs. Clinton about her
email practices, she has sought to offer a more contrite tone, though her detractors say she is
still too grudging. (In an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said she
did not need to apologize for using a private email server. ...What I did was allowed,.. she said. ...It
was allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that...)
While Mrs. Clinton..È central message will remain focused on addressing income inequality and
lifting the middle class, she is scrapping the phrase ...everyday Americans,.. which advisers said
was confusing and did not resonate. (One compared it to the Walmart slogan, ...everyday low
prices...)
Mrs. Clinton will still evoke the joy brought into her life by her granddaughter, Charlotte, but,
given the child..È obvious advantages and privilege, will speak more broadly about building a
better future for all Americans..Èchildren and grandchildren.
And former President Bill Clinton, who has had virtually no presence on the campaign trail, will
begin to travel the country to help with fund-raising this fall, with his first event planned for
Chicago on Sept. 17.
Democrats have expressed concern that in some ways, the often reserved former first lady,
senator and secretary of state does not seem aligned with the mood of the electorate this cycle,
with voters flocking to anti-establishment firebrands like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. Her
campaign strategists, however, believe voters..Èfrustration stems from a sense that Washington is not working for them and not necessarily with
the establishment.
Ms. Palmieri summed up the theme, repeating a line Mrs. Clinton had first offered last month:
...She said ...I want to be the president who addresses the problems in the headlines and the ones
that keep you up at night...È.È.ÈNext month contains two big tests for Mrs. Clinton. The first Democratic debate is Oct. 13,
putting her on stage alongside Mr. Sanders and other candidates eager to tangle with her. And
scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton..È private email use will intensify as she prepares to testify before the
House Select Committee on Benghazi on Oct. 22.
While many of Mrs. Clinton..È aides still contend that the issues surrounding her email are
overhyped, they also now realize the campaign was too slow to take responsibility for what
happened and explain the intricacies clearly.
...Part of this is saying we understand Americans don..È always hear all the facts, and they want to
see their candidates saying they made a mistake and being contrite,..È.Èsaid Thomas R. Nides, a
former State Department aide and friend to Mrs. Clinton.
The coming months will also be a period of trying to shed her scriptedness, which is not easy for
the policy-driven Mrs. Clinton, who in this campaign can easily be upstaged by the celebrity of
Mr. Trump and the giant crowds attracted by Mr. Sanders.
On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton will appear on ...The Ellen DeGeneres Show,..È.Èa prfogram on which
she previously participated in a bowl-off against the host. She is also booked as a guest on ...The
Tonight Show.. with Jimmy Fallon, and plans to talk extensively with several nontraditional
outlets. The campaign has even tried to make the best out of the private emails released by the
State Department, saying details revealed in the messages, like Mrs. Clinton..È TV preferences
(...The Good Wife.. and ...Parks and Recreation..) help humanize her.
Mrs. Clinton will focus on larger events and backyard parties with supporters that allow her to
show a more informal side, aides said. Still, Democrats add, there is only so much Mrs. Clinton
can do, given her well-known political identity.
...At the end of the day, she is the establishment candidate and she just has to figure out how she
wears that,.. said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. ...It..È something to navigate. You can..È
shed it...
Asked whether Mrs. Clinton is discouraged by the setbacks she has encountered so far, her
strategists argue that the candidate, having been through her husband..È tumultuous presidential
campaigns and her own failed effort in 2008, always anticipated trying times and occasional
explosions.
...She has developed a thick skin and a very good perspective on how campaigns are going to go
and they are long, they are a hard slog and you are going to get attacked,.. Ms. Palmieri said.
Whether the blueprint her strategists are preparing will be enough to overcome Mrs. Clinton..È
weaknesses is an open question. Some pollsters have pointed to a likability problem with the
former first lady, and, in presidential contests, the more likable candidate typically wins.
Still, she is optimistic about her chances and upbeat most of the time, the aides said. Since
declaring her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton has embraced a rigorous diet (when staff members set up
a mouthwatering spread of barbecue after a stop in Arkansas, she chose to eat just a single
tomato), lost significant weight and thrown herself into yoga and weight training, giving her new
energy.
Asked about the most powerful moments of the past several months, her strategists pointed to
an impromptu exchange about race with an African-American owner of a smoothie stand in
Detroit that went largely uncovered by the news media and the New Hampshire gathering with
recovering drug addicts that evolved into something of a therapy session.
...That captured the essence of her leadership style,.. Mr. Mook said.
Asked about a moment they regret, Ms. Palmieri paused and then quickly settled on the rope
the campaign used to wall off reporters at a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire that
became a symbol of Mrs. Clinton..È distance from the small town celebration. A less intrusive
rope had also been used to control crowds at other events.
The Brooklyn headquarters, located on the 11th floor of a high-rise, bustled with activity heading
into the Labor Day weekend. Young people, sitting on bean bag chairs, worked on their laptops
and cellphones. Bags of Hillary-branded snacks, like beet chips, were arrayed in front of a
volunteer hall of fame collage.
Mrs. Clinton was not present. The next day, she would end what may be the last vacation she
will have for a while, to hit campaign stops in Puerto Rico, New Hampshire and Iowa. Her
favorite part of the campaign is talking to voters, her aides said.
...Emails are not what voters are asking her about,..È.ÈMs. Palmieri said.

6,0,"OTTAWA...A foreign policy debate between the three main party leaders vying for power highlighted wide gaps over how Canada should exercise its military might, work with its main allies and play a stronger role in the world.
Staged before a live audience of 3,000 people at Toronto..È Roy Thomson Hall, it featured a combative performance by Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau who accused Conservative Leader Stephen Harper of damaging the most important foreign relationship Canada has ... with the United States ... because of Harper..È inability to get along with those he disagrees with.
Trudeau assailed Harper for ...haranguing.. the U.S. administration over foot-dragging on whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, saying Harper has narrowed the Canada-U.S. relationship down to that single issue.
...The fact is that Canadians are sitting around worried about their jobs because we have a prime minister that doesn..È like Barack Obama,.. Trudeau charged in one of the sharpest exchanges of the evening.
Stung, Harper defended his record and his personal rapport with Obama.
...We have a great relationship with the U.S administration and I have a great relationship with President Obama and by the way, the Americans have never said otherwise and neither have we. This is just an invention...
Harper said he spoke directly to Obama about the pipeline in limbo, and ...he said to me there..È nothing he..È asking Canada to do; he..È going to make that decision based on his own assessment of American interests...
But the debate ... the fourth of the campaign so far ... largely turned into a bitter struggle between the Liberals and NDP over who is the most likely agent of change from the Conservatives, with New Democrat Leader Tom Mulcair trying to strike a contrast every chance he got.
The evening kicked off with a sharp Harper-Mulcair duel over when Canada should deploy its armed forces if not against a brutal foe like the so-called Islamic State ... a duel that soon developed into a three-way fight.
Mulcair said it was not a multilateral effort led by the United Nations or Canada..È NATO allies unlike the mission in Libya which the NDP backed. ...We understand that there will be times when we have to, either under the NATO charter or under our international obligations at the UN, use force,.. Mulcair said. ...We won..È shy away from that...
Harper retorted that although not a NATO-led mission, all Canada..È NATO partners support the fight against ISIS, and suggested his political rivals are naive. Canada still participates in peacekeeping around the world, but there ...is not a peacekeeping mission to be had right now in Iraq and Syria.. against the fundamentalist Islamist militias of ISIS, said Harper.
...Why we would abandon this mission is a question that goes begging...
The battle between Trudeau and Mulcair to define themselves as the leader with the policies most in line with Canadian values and traditions crystallized in fierce exchanges over the Liberals..Èsupport for controversial anti-terrorism amendments the Conservatives enacted in Bill C-51.
Mulcair savaged Trudeau, repeatedly suggesting the Liberal leader lacked political courage. He said the NDP is the only party that voted for Canadians..Èfreedoms and liberties against overarching state surveillance.
...I..È not afraid of Stephen Harper, I voted against C-51,.. he said to Trudeau.
Trudeau accused Mulcair of ...stoking fear.. in Canadians by suggesting that Canada is turning into a police state, with their rights being taken away.
The debate canvassed a range of issues with all leaders getting in sharp, partisan and sometimes personal jabs about issues from Arctic sovereignty, Russia..È occupation of Crimea in Ukraine, and Canada..È relationship with its main ally, the United States.
Trudeau scoffed at Harper..È claim to have defended Arctic sovereignty. ...The one thing they keep saying about you up there Mr. Harper is you..Èe big sled, no dogs...
Yet it was over Canada..È relationship to the U.S. that the three leaders clashed over climate change, trade and the American administration..È seeming reluctance to approve the Keystone XL pipeline proposal.
Harper said his government has worked ...with two radically different administrations in the U.S... under Republican and Democratic leaders, and worked ...productively with both...
...
At another point, Trudeau and Harper clashed sharply over the Conservatives..Èdecision to revoke the citizenship of an Islamic extremist who masterminded a plot to bomb downtown Toronto.
Harper defended the decision to strip citizenship from Zakaria Amara, saying, ...A few blocks from here, (he) would have detonated bombs that would have been on a scale of 9-11. This country has every right to revoke the citizenship of an individual like that...
Trudeau said the man ...should be in jail.. but, ...We have a rule of law in this country and you can..È take away citizenship because you don..È like what someone does...
Trudeau challenged Harper..È claim to have acted on climate change, saying that in the face of federal ...inaction,.. provinces took action themselves, such as when Ontario shut down the province..È coal plants.
Although Green Party Leader Elizabeth May was not invited to participate in the Munk Debate, she posted video responses to the questions on Twitter. Many of her answers, including on the Arctic and the Islamic State, referred to climate change as one of the greatest threats posed to Canada and the world.

7,0,"AMHERST, N.S....Stephen Harper..È Conservatives have taken a tumble in public support, new poll results reveal.
New polling released Monday night has the NDP on top with 33 per cent, the Liberals in second at 31 per cent and the Tories down to 26 per cent.
According to pollster Nik Nanos, the NDP have gained three points in the past month. The Liberals are up as well, jumping two points. However, the Tories have slid to third, dropping five points and losing their front-runner status.
Through the first half of this marathon election campaign, the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats had been tightly bunched in public support. But this most recent poll, done for the Globe and Mail and CTV News, shows the NDP and Liberals cementing their support at the expense of the Conservatives.
Though the Oct. 19 election day remains more than a month away, the new numbers will be jarring for the Conservatives. When Harper launched the campaign in early August ... making it one of the country..È longest and costliest elections in history ... he declared at the time that the economy and national security were the central issues facing Canadian voters.
Since then, his party struggled to get its message out as unexpected momentum-draining events batter it.
They started with damning revelations at the trial of former Conservative senator Mike Duffy that raised fresh questions about the involvement of Harper..È inner circle in the secret $90,000 payment to the senator.
Then new data confirming the Canadian economy was in a recession for the first half of 2015 undercut the Tory messaging on the economy.
Last week the migrant crisis in Europe was driven home by the worldwide circulation of photos of the tragic death of a young Syrian boy whose family had sought to come to Canada.
That put the spotlight on whether the Conservative government was doing enough to assist with the crisis and put Immigration Minister Chris Alexander in the hot seat.
Now it seems some of those headlines are starting to take their toll on Harper and his party as they endeavour to win a rare fourth mandate.
In Ontario, the polling has the Liberals ahead with 38 per cent, the Conservatives second with 32 per cent and the New Democrats in third with 25 per cent.

8,0,"OTTAWA...The Syrian refugee crisis dominated the federal election campaign trail Friday, as party-leaders traded barbs over whose approach is wrong-headed and endangers lives.
Stark differences emerged over the best approach to dealing with the human tide of refugees fleeing violence in Syria.
Conservative leader Stephen Harper slammed the other parties, aiming most of his criticism at NDP leader Thomas Mulcair, saying he has adopted a ...totally irresponsible position.. in suggesting ...we can resolve this crisis just with refugee policy...
Harper argued a three-prong approach is required: increasing the intake of refugees from the region, supplying humanitarian aid on the ground, and offering military support to fight Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
...Anything else is inadequate and is a cop-out and this country will not do it,.. Harper said, to loud applause from party supporters in Whitehorse.
Earlier, the NDP leader dismissed Harper..È claim that military action is key. Mulcair insisted Canada has the resources to start processing 10,000 Syrian refugees ...before the end of this year,.. something the NDP platform promises to do.
NDP leader Thomas Mulcair pointed out that military action would not have saved the life of Alan Kurdi, 3, ""that poor boy on the beach...

GRAHAM HUGHES / CP

NDP leader Thomas Mulcair pointed out that military action would not have saved the life of Alan Kurdi, 3, ""that poor boy on the beach...

...We have the means to do that. We..Èe proven it in the past [that] when we want to do something we can do it,.. Mulcair said at a campaign event in Brossard, Que., on Friday.
...But military action would not have saved the life of that poor boy on the beach...
Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau said Thursday that ...Canada must immediately accept 25,000 Syrian refugees, stop dragging its heels...
There are few details about how that plan should work. But, on Friday, Trudeau told reporters in Richmond Hill that what it takes is ...simply political will...
...We have done that in the past in moments of crisis. We can do that again...
All three party leaders, Harper, Mulcair and Trudeau have expressed their sorrow at both the images of the lifeless body of Alan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy on a Turkish beach and the mourning of his Canadian family in Coquitlam, B.C.
The governing Conservative party insisting that along with humanitarian aid and refugee policy, engagement in the military campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is a crucial to resolving the problem and to protecting Canada..È own security.
...We also have to do something about the root cause,.. said Harper.
...The NDP..È position on these things is deeply ideological, and it is deeply wrong and it is out of step with what Canadians believe...
However the Conservative government, which refugee advocacy groups suggest relies more heavily on private sponsorship of refugees than government-sponsorships, appears to have narrowed its focus to Kurdish Yazidis and Christian refugees fleeing persecution in the region.
Harper..È immigration minister Chris Alexander says the Conservative government, if re-elected, would allow in an ...additional 10,000 persecuted ethnic and religious minorities from the region...
Harper said Friday his approach is not based on a belief that Syrian refugees are a security threat, but he said ...there are issues of fairness.
...You want to make sure that of all the millions that could apply you..Èe bringing in the most vulnerable.
...Also this is a war zone so there are security things that have to be checked...
The Conservatives..Èproposed increase of 10,000 refugees would apply to Syrians and Iraqis, not just those from Syria where the population is fleeing both a brutal dictator in Bashar Assad, and the brutally violent insurgent Islamist group known as Islamic State, ISIL or ISIS, which is trying to claim territory for a fundamentalist Islamist state.
The NDP has targeted Syrian refugees in its plan.
It promises to ...get 10,000 government-sponsored refugees out of harm..È way and on the way to Canada by the end of this year by appointing a Syrian Refugee Coordinator, pulling resources from various departments, including Foreign Affairs, Citizenship and Immigration and other departments...
It calls for: boosting the presence of Canadian diplomatic and immigration officials in the region to accelerate processing of refugees; coordination with Turkey and other affected countries ...to remove bureaucratic obstacles to resettlement,.. and for treating ...all refugees equally...
The NDP, too, embraces private sponsorship of refugees, and promises to fast-track private sponsorship with no cap ...to bring as many people as possible to Canada... Mulcair says he will increase aid to humanitarian-assistance agencies, including the UNHCR, ...based on the needs on the ground...
Conservative Leader Harper, seeking a fourth term as prime minister, acknowledged Friday cases have to be processed more quickly.
...Look, we realize we have to bring in more and we have to do it more effectively and quickly...
But he gave no indication how much money he could commit to streamline the processing of applicants.
The Conservative record is facing tougher scrutiny after news that the Kurdi family had relatives in B.C. who were trying to bring the extended family to safety both in Canada and Europe.
The Harper government had set a target for Canada to accept 23,000 Iraqi refugees and 11,300 Syrians. Of that number, Canada has already resettled nearly 22,000 Iraqis. Just 2,300 Syrians have arrived.
Harper says the Conservative promises to accept 10,000 more from the region, spread over three years, are more generous than pledges made by other Western countries.",,,,,,,,22.85,8.22,2.35,5.87,14.41,11.85,4.8,2.45,3.42,2.13,4.7,6.4,0.21,0.11,0,0,4.7,0,0

9,0,"OTTAWA...Elections Canada has quietly warned staff to be on the lookout for increasingly sophisticated tactics aimed at discouraging ... or even stopping ... voters from casting a ballot.
The advanced voter suppression techniques flourishing in the United States are likely to spill into other countries, employees were advised in a presentation aimed at raising awareness prior to the Oct. 19 federal election.
The digital revolution has fuelled intensive data analysis south of the border that allows political parties to zero in on people who support rival candidates and then find ways to prevent them from voting.
The development prompted Elections Canada to comb through academic papers and media reports and talk to experts and lawyers about the phenomenon of electoral malpractice.
...It..È important for us to identify potential risks in order to be prepared to detect and respond to incidents that may occur, including incidents that could compromise the integrity of the election,.. said Elections Canada spokesman John Enright.
A copy of the May 2014 presentation, ...An Introduction to Emerging Trends and Threats in Electoral Operations,.. was released to The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act.
It was prepared just months before Conservative campaign worker Michael Sona was convicted of taking part in a scheme to misdirect voters in Guelph, Ont., to phoney poll locations during the 2011 campaign.
The research revealed that rough-and-tumble American political campaigns are the seedbeds of such behaviour ... identifying 17 cases in 15 states from 2004 through 2012.
...We need look no further than the United States to find a vast overview of contemporary voter suppression and surveillance practices,.. the presentation notes say.
Elections Canada cites four stages of a successful voter suppression plan:
Identify non-supporters;
Gather information on them;
Prevent them from going to the polls through scare tactics, misinformation or systematic challenging of registrations;
If electors get to the polls, prevent them from voting by contesting eligibility or identification, and through intimidation.
Eleven years ago, one party took the fairly broad-brush approach of assuming students at a historically black college in Florida would not be supporters, the presentation points out. The party then systematically challenged the eligibility of voters on that list, resulting in long poll lineups and delays.
But today the same computer software that allows parties to build massive databases with detailed information about likely supporters also enables them to more precisely identify ... and target ... non-supporters.
Parties use voter lists, digital maps, and information from public or commercial sources to build personal profiles ... each containing up to 250 pieces of data, from basic demographic information to culinary or musical tastes.
...These databases allow campaigns to send micro-targeted messages to specific audiences,.. the notes say.
For instance, Spanish-speaking voters in Arizona received robocalls and mailouts in 2012 advising them to vote after election day.
In Maryland, tens of thousands of Democratic voters were apparently targeted by robocalls in 2010 falsely saying their candidate had already won the election.
The U.S. has also seen the rise of ...poll watchers.. recruited by activist groups, the notes say. ...They often harass voters in predominantly minority voting districts, create anxiety and agitate voters...
Another tactic involves handing out flyers threatening jail time or other penalties for those who vote ...illegally.. ... a means of dissuading those who are unsure of their registration status or whether they have the correct identification.
A multi-party parliamentary system like Canada..È may be especially affected by such micro-targeting, which tends to ...consolidate power in the larger, more well financed political parties.. at the expense of smaller ones, the Elections Canada notes say.
In addition, micro-targeting can have a ...disproportionate impact.. on parliamentary systems, where subtle shifts in voter behaviour of specific slivers of the electorate in key electoral districts ...can indeed affect the distribution of seats in the legislature and even the composition of the government...",,,,,,,,28.04,4.65,1.86,2.79,17.36,8.84,4.5,2.48,3.88,1.71,4.03,4.19,0.16,0.47,0,0,3.1,0,0

10,0,"OTTAWA...The longest election campaign in modern Canadian history hits the midway point this week and political parties are ramping up their advertising wars.
Under new changes brought in last year by the Conservative government, campaign spending limits increase with the length of the writ period, meaning a party with a full slate of 338 candidates this year can spend almost $54.5 million.
According to Elections Canada returns, the big three national parties spent between 39 and 50 per cent of their 2011 election campaign budgets on TV and radio advertising ... a combined total of $28 million, not including ...local.. ads by individual candidates, who have their own spending limits.
If the same proportions hold true this year, the Conservative, New Democrat and Liberal national parties could pour an unprecedented $20 to $30 million each into their respective air wars, plus millions more in regional ads by local candidates.
All that ad spending is not evenly spread over the length of a campaign. Parties tend to go heavy in the first week as each tries to establish the ballot question, ramp up again around the major televised leaders..Èdebates and then go all out over the final 10 days, when voters are firming up their choices.
This year..È 11-week campaign ... from Aug. 2, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked that Parliament be dissolved, to election day Oct. 19 ... has introduced a new advertising dynamic. So has the unusual three-way race that has the NDP, Liberals and Conservatives all within hailing distance of one another.
Political parties don..È divulge their media buy strategies, and many advertisements that are floated in party announcements never actually air on TV. However, given the increasing importance of web viewership, the once-clear distinction between ads that merit a TV buy and those that only run online is blurring.
...Advertising is a window to the campaign,.. Jason Lietaer, the president of Enterprise Canada who ran the Conservative campaign ...war room.. in the 2011 election, wrote in a blog post this week.
...There..È lots of ways to figure out where the parties think they stand, but they pay a lot of attention to advertising. It..È where the real money is spent and it has the potential to move a larger number of votes more quickly than any other medium...
Here..È a look at the state of play in the ad wars through the first five weeks of the 78-day campaign: 
Conservatives: The deep-pocketed governing party has been blanketing the airwaves with ads attacking Justin Trudeau since last May, long before the official campaign began.
...The Interview.. series, in which actors pretend to examine Trudeau..È resum.© before declaring him ...just not ready,.. was a fixture throughout August on everything from news channels and sports networks to specialty channels such as Discovery and the Space Channel, according to sightings posted on social media.
The Conservative party has aired at least five different versions of ...The Interview,.. focusing on different issues and claims about Trudeau..È platform. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair gets the treatment in one version.
Harper, with a nine-year record to run on, has been largely absent from the Conservative ad campaign so far. A new English-language Conservative ad features actors talking about the leadership options and ends with a white-haired woman earnestly stating: ...Stephen Harper isn..È perfect, but when it comes to the economy we can depend on him... A new French-language ad being shopped by the party this week paints Tom Mulcair..È NDP as ...too risky...

New Democratic Party: The NDP has been leading in national public opinion polls since the official campaign began and have coasted on that front-runner status with an almost non-existent media buy until this week, presumably mustering their resources for a big push later in the campaign when they hope to seal the deal.
A new, soft-focus NDP ad narrated by Mulcair is going into paid circulation this week, while a hard-hitting attack ad targeting a list of Harper appointees in legal difficulties generated plenty of online buzz and earned media but did not appear to be the subject of a significant media buy.
Liberals: The Liberals under Trudeau have faced paid Conservative attack ads literally since the day Trudeau was chosen party leader in April 2013. The barrage only intensified with the start of the election campaign last month and the Liberals responded with a paid election ad that appeared to break one of the cardinal rules of politics: it repeated the language of an opponent..È criticisms.
Nonetheless, the ad with Trudeau declaring himself ...ready.. to govern appears to have received a significant financial push, appearing everywhere from NASCAR, baseball, soccer, Canadian Football League and NFL preseason telecasts to the Food Network and at least one episode of Citytv..È ...Bachelor in Paradise...
A more recent ad featuring Trudeau talking about the economy while on an escalator is also getting paid air time, according to social media sightings.

11,0,"Obama Condemns ...Routine..Èof Mass
Shootings, Says U.S. Has Become Numb
By GARDINER HARRIS and MICHAEL D. SHEAR OCT. 1, 2015
WASHINGTON ... President Obama..È rage about gun massacres, building for
years, spilled out Thursday night as he acknowledged his own powerlessness to
prevent another tragedy and pleaded with voters to force change themselves.
...So tonight, as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little
closer are thinking about the families who aren..È so fortunate,.. the president
said in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, named for a man severely
wounded by a would-be assassin..È bullet, ...I..È ask the American people to think
about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save these
lives and let these people grow up...
Mr. Obama admitted that he was unable to do anything to prevent such
tragedies by himself. And he did little to try to hide the anger and frustration
that have deepened as he returns again and again to the White House lectern
in the wake of a deadly mass shooting.
Mr. Obama took a veiled swipe at the National Rifle Association, which
has successfully fought most limits on gun use and manufacture and has
pushed through legislation in many states making gun ownership far easier.
...And I would particularly ask America..È gun owners who are using those guns
properly, safely, to hunt for sport, for protecting their families, to think about
whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that
suggests it is speaking for you,.. he said.
Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to respond to
Mr. Obama, saying that it was the organization..È policy ...not to comment until
all the facts are known... Wayne LaPierre, the organization..È executive vice
president, declared after the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., ...The only
thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun...
On Thursday night, Mr. Obama said that given the frequency of mass
shootings, people had ...become numb to this...
...And what..È become routine, of course, is the response of those who
oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation,.. Mr. Obama said. ...Right
now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out. ...We need more guns,..Èthey..Èl argue. ...Fewer gun-safety laws...È..
...Does anybody really believe that?.. he asked, his voice rising.
Mr. Obama sought to answer that question years ago. After the massacre
in 2012 of 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in
Newtown, he promised to use all the powers of his office to push for legislative
changes that polls suggest were widely supported.
...Are we really prepared to say that we..Èe powerless in the face of such
carnage, that the politics are too hard?.. Mr. Obama asked then.
Less than a month later, Mr. Obama unveiled a proposal to overhaul the
nation..È gun laws that would have included universal background checks and a
spate of other measures he deemed ...concrete steps.. aimed at preventing more
mass shootings.
...This is how we will be judged,.. he said in January 2013.
The judgment came just a few months later, as lawmakers from both
parties forcefully rejected the centerpiece of the president..È gun control
agenda. At the time, and also visibly upset, Mr. Obama stood in the Rose
Garden to denounce the opponents of new gun measures even as he
acknowledged the futility of his efforts.
He called it a ...shameful day.. in Washington and promised that eventually,
...I believe we..Èe going to be able to get this done... In a Twitter message on
Thursday, Dan Pfeiffer, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Obama until this year,
remembered that afternoon as ...the most frustrated I ever saw President
Obama in 8 years...
With each massacre since, Mr. Obama has been forced to help the country
grieve, as presidents are called upon to do in national tragedies. Thirteen dead
at the Washington Navy Yard; three dead at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex.; nine
dead in a church in Charleston, S.C.
And with each massacre, his sense of powerless anger and frustration has
built.
But what was different this time was that the president did not announce
any new initiative or effort to fix the problem. Instead, he pointed out that
there is ...a gun for roughly every man, woman and child in America. So how
can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us
safer?..
States and countries that have gun limits have far fewer gun deaths than
those that do not, he said. ...So we know there are ways to prevent it,.. he said.
He pointed out that the government responds to mine disasters by
insisting on safer mines, to weather disasters by improving community safety,
and to highway deaths by fixing roads and insisting that drivers wear seatbelts.
But guns are seen as so different that Congress has forbidden the federal
government even to collect certain statistics, he said. He rejected the notion
that the Constitution forbids even modest regulation of deadly weapons.
He also asked news organizations to tally the number of Americans killed
by terrorist attacks over the last 10 years and compare that with the number
killed by domestic gun violence. And he implicitly compared the trillions of
dollars spent and multiple agencies devoted to preventing the relatively few
terrorism deaths with the minimal effort and money spent to prevent the far
greater number of gun deaths.
And then he challenged voters to make gun safety a priority.
...If you think this is a problem, then you should expect your elected
officials to reflect your views,.. he said.
Mr. Obama has long been seen as fairly unemotional, even distant. His
speeches since being elected in 2008 have sometimes seemed like lectures
from the constitutional law professor he once was. But he is also a father, one
who insists on eating dinner with his daughters.
Shootings, particularly at schools, have seemingly brought together his
roles as president and father in ways nothing else has. And that combination
brings forth the kind of raw emotion he almost never betrays.
His eulogy in June for the victims of the massacre in Charleston, for
instance, was widely considered one of his most impassioned, and included
singing the opening refrain of ...Amazing Grace...
Thursday night, he had little of the soaring language and certainly none of
the hope he expressed in Charleston. But he promised to continue hammering
away at this issue for the rest of his presidency.
...Each time this happens, I..È going to bring this up,.. he said. ...Each time
this happens, I..È going to say that we can actually do something about it...

13,0,"Texas Lawmakers Pass a Bill Allowing
Guns at Colleges
By MANNY FERNANDEZ and DAVE MONTGOMERY JUNE 2, 2015
HOUSTON ... Students and faculty members at public and private universities
in Texas could be allowed to carry concealed handguns into classrooms,
dormitories and other buildings under a bill passed over the weekend by the
Republican-dominated Legislature. The measure is being hailed as a victory by
gun rights advocates and criticized by many students and professors as
irresponsible and unnecessary.
The so-called campus-carry bill is expected to be signed into law by the
Republican governor, Greg Abbott. It would take effect in August 2016 at
universities and August 2017 at community colleges.
Supporters say it will make college campuses safer by not preventing
licensed gun owners from defending themselves and possibly saving lives
should a mass shooting occur, such as the one that unfolded at Virginia Tech
University in 2007.
Opponents say the notion that armed students would make a campus safer
is an illusion that will have a chilling effect on campus life. Professors said they
worry about inviting a student into their offices to talk about a failing grade if
they think that student is armed. And Democratic lawmakers and some
university leaders worry about increased security costs and the bill..È effect on
recruiting potential teachers and students from other states.
...The perception in academia will be that Texas is a free-fire zone with
yokels in the classrooms packing heat,.. said Lynn W. Tatum, a professor at
Baylor University in Waco and the former president of the Texas conference of
the American Association of University Professors.
Texas will be one of eight states to allow the carrying of concealed
weapons on public college campuses, joining Colorado, Idaho, Kansas,
Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures. Nineteen others ban concealed weapons on
campus, including California, Florida and New York, and 23 others, including
Alabama and Arizona, leave the decision to the colleges or state board of
regents.
The bill that passed in Texas was something of a compromise that allows
private universities to opt out and public ones to designate parts of their
campuses as gun-free zones. But coming at a time when legislatures have
allowed guns at places from bars to houses of worship, it reflects the seemingly
limitless legislative clout of gun interests, particularly in Republicandominated
states.
One of the most prominent opponents of the campus-carry bill was an
unlikely figure ... a former member of the Navy SEALs. Adm. William H.
McRaven, the former commander of United States Special Operations forces
who directed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, is now the chancellor of the
15-campus University of Texas System.
...I..È a guy that loves my guns,.. Admiral McRaven said. ...I have all sorts of
guns. I just don..È think bringing guns on campus is going to make us any safer.
If you..Èe ever been shot at, which I have, then you have an appreciation for
what a gun can do...
In addition to the campus-carry bill, Republican lawmakers also approved
an open-carry bill, which gives those licensed to have a concealed weapon the
option of carrying it openly in a holster, although open carry will not be
allowed on a college campus. The debate over both bills made gun rights a
dominant issue of the legislative session.
One of the bill..È chief architects was Senator Brian Birdwell, a Republican
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel wounded in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on
the Pentagon. Those backing it included local and national gun rights groups,
including Students for Concealed Carry and the state affiliate of the National
Rifle Association; Tea Party activists; and Sheriff Parnell McNamara of
McLennan County, which includes Waco. Other law enforcement officials
testified against the bill, including Adrian Garcia, who at the time was the
sheriff of Harris County, which includes Houston.
Supporters said that because Texans licensed to have concealed firearms
must be 21 years or older, the number of the state..È 850,000 license holders
who will ultimately carry on campus will be small, and will most likely be older
community college students more interested in protecting themselves as they
walk to their cars at night on campus than in carrying their weapons to a
fraternity party.
...An armed society is a safe society, so any time you have gun control, there
is far more opportunity to become victims,.. said State Representative
Jonathan Stickland, a Republican and Tea Party favorite who often does his
legislative work at the Capitol wearing his concealed .40-caliber semiautomatic
pistol. ...The criminals aren..È going to obey the laws. It..È the responsible folks
who we should be encouraging to protect themselves in the community they
live in...
At the University of Texas at Austin, interviews with more than a dozen
students Tuesday found little support for campus carry. The university was the
scene of the nation..È first campus mass shooting on Aug. 1, 1966, when a
sniper, Charles Whitman, fired at people from the school..È clock tower in a day
of violence that left 16 people dead. The campus-carry law will take effect there
Aug. 1, 2016, exactly 50 years later.
...I don..È think guns should be allowed, because that..È pretty scary,.. said
Sarah Wang, 18, a computer science major and sophomore who stood near the
tower. ...We..Èe already seen so many instances where people get hurt because
there are guns in schools...
In some ways, the legislative battle over the bill was symbolic. For years,
Texans who were licensed by the state to carry a concealed firearm had never
been prohibited under the law from walking on or through the grounds of most
college campuses with their weapon. The bill gives those licensed to carry a
concealed firearm the right to have their firearms while they are inside
buildings and clarifies that they can be armed while on campus, although
several caveats pushed by Democratic lawmakers will dampen the impact of
the legislation.
The bill gives private and independent colleges the option of opting out
entirely. Public colleges have no such option, but lawmakers allowed university
presidents at public institutions to come up with concealed-weapons
regulations that could let them establish gun-free zones on their campuses.
The bill says university officials can establish ...reasonable rules,.. but states
those regulations cannot ...generally prohibit.. license holders from carrying
concealed handguns on campus.
...While the passage of campus carry is disappointing, the legislation is
better than it could have been in that we will be able to exercise some local
control,.. said Neal J. Smatresk, president of the University of North Texas, a
public institution in Denton. ...We need to review the legislation thoroughly to
ensure that we understand our latitude in controlling concealed carry on
campus...
The Texas version of campus carry is more watered down than the laws
passed by other states. In Utah, the presidents of the public colleges have no
discretion to write concealed-handgun rules. At Southern Utah University in
Cedar City, students and faculty can have concealed weapon just about
anywhere on campus ... in classrooms, dormitory buildings and at sporting
events.
...It..È never been an issue,.. said Rick Brown, the university..È chief of police.
The only episode he could recall was the day a few years ago when a
teacher found a loaded clip in a classroom after class was dismissed and
notified the campus police. Mr. Brown said the clip apparently fell out of a
student..È backpack during class.

Tex.

14,0,"Year After Death, Business as Usual at
Arizona Gun Range
By JULIE TURKEWITZ AUG. 22, 2015
WHITE HILLS, Ariz. ... Antonio N.rdiz, a Spanish tourist from Bilbao, said he
had chosen a family vacation to America for one specific reason: to fulfill his
sons..Èdreams of firing real machine guns. In Spain, he noted, 10-year-old Jon
and 12-year-old Toni, like all other civilians, are forbidden to use automatic
weapons.
Mr. N.rdiz, 47, had heard that a family trip to an American gun range
turned tragic last year when a 9-year-old girl lost control of an Uzi submachine
gun, killing her instructor. So when Mr. N.rdiz selected that same range for his
family..È adventure ... a place called Last Stop, just an hour..È drive from Las
Vegas ... he called ahead to ask about security. Someone told him, ...It..È
practically impossible for an accident to occur,.. he said.
In the year since a New Jersey girl visited Last Stop and accidentally killed
Charles Vacca, a 39-year-old father of four, little has changed in the nation..È
tourist-oriented machine gun ranges. Last Stop..È range, which receives 100 to
200 visitors a week, is one of about a dozen places in the Las Vegas area that
offer machine gun adventures.
...I promised that one day I would bring them to fire guns,.. Mr. N.rdiz said
just after his children had used automatic weapons to pound bullets into a dirtpacked
berm. ...So I looked on the Internet, and I found this place. Everyone
spoke very highly of it. And the truth is that it..È fantastic...
Mr. Vacca..È death on Aug. 25 prompted a brief but impassioned
conversation: Should Arizona and other states continue to allow children to
fire automatic weapons? A video of the girl and the gun in the moments before
Mr. Vacca..È death ... she wore pink shorts and a ponytail ... helped fuel the
debate.
This summer, the owner of Last Stop placed the blame squarely on his
employee, saying that while Mr. Vacca had been a beloved instructor, he had
died because he broke a company rule by standing next to the girl, not behind
her. The power of the gun in the hands of a preteen, the owner said, was not to
blame.
...We operate at the highest ... a higher level of safety than most of the gun
ranges I..Èe visited all over the world,.. said the owner, Sam Scarmardo, 63.
Since Mr. Vacca..È death, he said, ...there really wasn..È an awful lot of safety
improvement...
Workers at several Las Vegas ranges said they still allowed children to
shoot, noting that they had long worked with young people and were well
equipped to do so. The Range 702 in Las Vegas, for example, allows people
ages 10 and up to shoot and has benches that instructors can adjust to different
heights.
Last Stop is a gas station and burger joint near the Nevada border. Mr.
Scarmardo added the range in 2013, and it is associated with a company called
Bullets and Burgers that picks up families and party groups at Las Vegas hotels
and brings them here to shoot guns and then enjoy a hamburger and a beer.
The company promises visitors a ...Desert Storm atmosphere.. and the
opportunity to shoot ...the actual firearms.. used in movies like ...Rambo: First
Blood Part II...
To many visitors, the experience is as quintessentially American as a
roller-coaster ride at Disney World or a boat tour at Niagara Falls.
...This is the American dream, right?.. said Daniel Calvo, 31, a Spanish
tourist who had just sent a burst of bullets flying as five friends in flip-flops
and shorts cheered him on. ...The guns, the trip to the Grand Canyon, the trip to
Las Vegas...
After Mr. Vacca..È death, a sheriff..È investigation ruled the killing an
accident, and an inspection of the range by the Arizona Division of
Occupational Safety and Health found only violations it deemed minor, like
failing to train an employee in the safe use of work-related chemicals.
Mr. Scarmardo said he had decided after the accident to raise the age
requirement for shooting to 12, from 9, though employees are allowed to waive
that rule when they deem a child large and mature enough to handle a
powerful weapon.
...If you..Èe got a kid who is five feet tall and as mature as a 25-year-old, he
can shoot,.. Mr. Scarmardo said.
He added that children were typically restricted to using M16s or belt-fed
guns that rest on a table or other surface, though a range employee later said
he was unaware of that rule.
Nearly all instructors have military experience and receive two weeks of
training before they can assist clients. Tourists receive a safety briefing of five
to 10 minutes before they pull a trigger.
After Mr. Vacca..È death, legislators in at least two states, Arizona and
Louisiana, tried to pass laws that would have set a minimum age for handling
an automatic weapon. Both efforts failed. State Representative Victoria Steele,
a Democrat who proposed the Arizona bill, said her colleagues would not
consider supporting a bill that restricted gun use, fearing a backlash from the
National Rifle Association.
Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have laws that restrict
firearm use by children in some way, according to the Law Center to Prevent
Gun Violence.
In the days after Mr. Vacca..È death, his children released a video in which
they forgave the girl, who had come here with her parents and brother. In their
first statement since the video, the children ... Ashley, 20, Elizabeth, 16, Tylor,
15, and Christopher, 12 ... said through lawyers that they wanted legislation
that would set age minimums for using automatic weapons.
...They say over and over again: We don..È want this to happen again,.. said
Marc Lamber, a lawyer for the Vacca family. ...What do we need to do to stop
this from happening again?..
The family has decided not to sue the range or the girl, he said, choosing
to focus on changing the law. ...Children shouldn..È be firing automatic
weapons,.. Mr. Lamber added. ...It..È just a matter of common sense... The
parents of the girl, identified by police as the MacLachlans, declined to
comment.
On a recent weekday, Mr. Calvo, one of the Spanish tourists, was surprised
to learn from a reporter that Last Stop was the scene of the killing he had
heard about last year. One of his friends, Samuel Pueyo, 29, said: ...Shooting is
fine as an experience, but for adults ... not for children. It..È not ethical for a
child...
But Mr. N.rdiz said he felt very safe, and his children, Jon and Toni,
agreed.
...Oh, my God,.. Jon said, rattling off the names of the guns he had fired:
the MP5, the M4. ...At the beginning it was a little scary, but it was so much
fun...

15,0,"GREENVILLE, S.C. ... Jeb Bush invited a firestorm on Friday by saying that ...stuff happens.. in reference to renewed calls for legislative action after tragedies like the mass shooting in Oregon.

...I had this challenge as governor because we had ... look, stuff happens,.. he said at a forum in South Carolina. ...There..È always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and it..È not necessarily the right thing to do...

The inelegant phrase immediately set off a wave of criticism from observers suggesting he was playing down the scourge of gun violence and the tragedy on Thursday, in which a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Roseburg, Ore.

Mr Bush, taking questions from the state..È attorney general, Alan Wilson, was speaking about a pattern of proposing legislative responses that he said did not halt the tragedies they were meant to stop.

Asked afterward about the ...stuff happens.. comment, Mr. Bush said, ...it wasn..È a mistake,.. and requested that a reporter point out ...what I said wrong...

...Things happen all the time,.. Mr. Bush said. ...Things. Is that better?..

Asked what he meant, Mr. Bush said he was talking more generally about the tendency to pass laws in response to tragic events.

...Tragedies,.. he said. ...A child drowned in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools. Well it may not change it. Or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event. And the cumulative effect of this is, in some cases, you don..È solve the problem by passing the law, and you..Èe imposing on large numbers of people burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder to protect liberty...

Mr. Bush said he was not referring specifically to Oregon when he said ...stuff happens...

At the forum at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., Mr. Bush boasted of his pro-gun record as Florida governor, recalling awards he received from the National Rifle Association and noting that he once received a gun from the group..È former president, Charlton Heston.

Hanlan said that police cornered the shooter in a campus building and exchanged gunfire.
...The shooter threat was neutralized,.. he said.
Late Thursday, a government official identified the shooter as Chris Harper Mercer, 26. A law enforcement official said the shooter had three weapons, handguns and at least one long gun, the New York Times reported.

Hanlin made no guesses as to the shooter..È motive and said the investigation is still ongoing and will likely be a long one.
The sheriff..È department could only confirm 10 dead and seven injured at this time, Hanlin said. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum had earlier reported that there were at least 13 dead and 20 injured.
The college in rural southwestern Oregon has about 3,000 students and is busy on weekday mornings, officials said.

Kortney Moore told local newspaper the Roseburg News-Review that she saw her writing teacher get shot in the head by a stray bullet that went through a window. The 18-year-old said she heard the shooter enter a nearby classroom in Snyder Hall and order people to get on the ground.
He lined people up and asked them to state their religion before opening fire, she said.
Brady Winder, 23, told the newspaper that he had been in the classroom next door.
He heard a thud and then gunfire before seeing students run out of a classroom ...like ants,.. adding that people were screaming, ...Get out!..
He said he saw one woman swim across a creek to get away.
It is the 45th school shooting in the United States this year, and the 142nd since the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., according to gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand Action.

...We see one of these every few months,.. Obama lamented. ...Each time this happens I..È going to bring this up. Each time this happens I am going to say we can actually do something about it. But we..Èe going to have to change our laws...
If the news of another school shooting feels routine, Obama argued, so too does the response on both sides of the gun-control debate.
Calls for stricter gun regulations in the U.S. have met with fierce opposition in Congress, and many expressed outrage on social media that today..È tragedy could have been prevented.
But those against tighter gun regulations accuse anti-gun advocates of ...politicizing.. the tragedy.
Hanlin, the sheriff overseeing the investigation, has been vocal in opposing state and federal gun-control legislation.
He told a legislative committee in March that a background-check mandate wouldn..È prevent criminals from getting firearms. Hanlin also sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden in 2013, after the Sandy Hook shootings. Hanlin said he and his deputies would refuse to enforce new gun-control restrictions ...offending the constitutional rights of my citizens...
In the aftermath of the shooting, students who weren..È injured were evacuated to a nearby fairground where they were offered counselling. It was intended to be a place where their parents could pick them up.

An estimated one million people have converged in central Paris for the Unity March joining in solidarity with the 17 victims of this week's terrorist attacks.

The three days of terror began Wednesday when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people. Al Qaeda..È branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honour of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly..È satire. Charlie Hebdo assailed Christianity, Judaism as well as officialdom of all stripes with its brand of sometimes crude satire that sought to put a thumb in the eye of authority and convention.
On Thursday, police said Coulibaly killed a policewoman on the outskirts of Paris and on Friday, the attackers converged. While the Kouachi brothers holed up in a printing plant near Charles de Gaulle airport, Coulibaly seized hostages inside a kosher market. It all ended at dusk Friday with near-simultaneous raids at the printing plant and the market that left all three gunmen dead. Four hostages at the market were also killed.
Five people who were held in connection with the attacks were freed late Saturday, leaving no one in custody, according to the Paris prosecutor..È office. Coulibaly..È widow is still being sought and was last traced near the Turkey-Syrian border.
Early Sunday, police in Germany detained two men suspected of an arson attack against a newspaper that republished cartoons from Charlie Hebdo. No one was injured in that attack.

...The terrorists want two things: they want to scare us and they want to divide us. We must do the opposite. We must stand up and we must stay united,.. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told French TV channel iTele on Sunday.
France remains on high alert while investigators determine whether the attackers were part of a larger extremist network. More than 5,500 police and soldiers were being deployed on Sunday across France, about half of them to protect the march. The others were guarding synagogues, mosques, schools and other sites around France.
...I hope that we will again be able to say we are happy to be Jews in France,.. said Haim Korsia, the chief rabbi in France, who planned to attend the rally.
At an international conference in India, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the world stood with the people of France ...not just in anger and in outrage, but in solidarity and commitment to the cause of confronting extremism and in the cause that extremists fear so much and that has always united our countries: freedom...

Asst. Commissioner Brian Brennan says a man who was found dead in a Halifax-area home early Friday intended to go to a public place with a woman and open fire on citizens before killing themselves.
Police received information from the public on Thursday morning of a potential significant weapons-related threat. The information suggested a 19-year-old Halifax-area man and a 23-year old woman from Geneva, Ill., had access to firearms, Brennan said.
...We received a threat that individuals were planning on targeting a public venue in Halifax, to go there and commit mass killings of civilians and to ultimately kill themselves,.. Brennan said in a phone interview Friday night.
...Given the public venue that we believe was to be targeted, there was the potential for significant casualties and injury to citizens...
Brennan would not say which venue was being targeted.

ANDREW VAUGHAN / THE CANADIAN PRESS
Police say they found a 19-year-old man dead early Friday in Timberlea, a Halifax suburb. The RCMP would not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his death.

He says two other male suspects, ages 20 and 17, were also involved, although he says investigators were still trying to determine what their role was.
Brennan said firearms have been seized, although he could not say what kind, how many, or where the weapons were seized.
...The weapons seized had the ability to inflict a lot of casualties if used in a populated area,.. said Brennan.
Police say they found the 19-year-old man dead at a home in the Halifax-area around 1:20 a.m. Friday.
Brennan would not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his death, saying the issue has been referred to the province..È Serious Incident Response Team, which reviews all serious incidents involving police in the province.
He said the 20-year-old man and 23-year-old woman were arrested around 2 a.m. at the Halifax airport. Brennan said the woman was arriving on a plane and the man was there to meet her.
The 17-year-old boy was arrested around 11 a.m. in the Halifax area, he said. Brennan said all three suspects remain in police custody and there..È no word on charges.

19,0,"When Gaith Mohammed, a young man in his twenties with a degree in accounting, went to see American Sniper during its opening week at Baghdad..È Mansour Mall, he says the theatre was full and rowdy.
...Some people watching were just concentrating, but others were screaming ...F--k, shoot him! He has an IED, don..È wait for permission!!..È. Mohammed laughed, recounting the film..È many tense scenes when U.S. Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper, radios in for authorization to take out a potential threat.
The film, set during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq and released on Christmas Day, hit nerves in the U.S. immediately. Some critics and commentators lauded it as patriotic and unflinching; others dismissed it as reductionist and racist.
Many people also objected to the film's portrayal of Kyle ... a man who described Iraqis as ...savages.. in his memoir ... as a hero.
Directed by Clint Eastwood, the movie is based on a book by the late Kyle, now known as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. It has broken records, topped box office sales and racked up Oscar nominations, including one for best picture.
It..È been stirring controversy in Iraq, too.
In Baghdad, where much of the film is set, the movie drew full crowds at one of the city..È new upscale cinemas. Dressed in a fur-collared coat and loafers, Mohammed says many of the showings were sold out, and he knows of people who had to book their tickets a day in advance during opening week.
But after just a week on screens, the Mansour Mall theatre pulled the movie. A theatre employee sitting at the box office says management made the decision ...because the hero of this film boasts of killing more than 160 Muslims... The employee declined to give his name because he did not have permission to speak to journalists.
Mansour Mall attracts a largely upscale crowd in Baghdad. Behind tall gates and multiple layers of security complete with metal detectors and X-ray belts, the theatres here show a mix of Western and Arab films. Moviegoers interviewed at the mall say big budget action movies are usually the most popular, but romantic comedies and family dramas also do well.
Mohammed, who lived through the events in Baghdad the film depicts, admits that scenes where women and children were killed were hard for him to watch. But all in all he liked the movie.
...I love watching war movies because especially now they give me the strength to face ISIS,.. he said, using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State. When asked if he thought the movie was racist or anti-Arab ... a charge made by some critics in the West ... he replied, ...No, why? The sniper was killing terrorists, the only thing that bothered me was when he said he didn..È know anything about the Qur..Èn!..
But not all Iraqis were cheering on ...Chief.. Kyle..È kills. Wael, a government ministry employee in his thirties, says the film was too violent. He..È happy it..È no longer being shown in some Baghdad theatres.
...To some extent, I considered it against all Muslims,.. he said. He also referred to the opening scene in Fallujah where a woman and child are killed.
...The sniper, he has a chance to hit the child and his mother in their foot or anywhere without killing them, but he didn..È because he..È bloodthirsty like all the American troops...
At the Mansour Mall foodcourt outside the theatre, Omar Jalal, a university student, says he..È upset American Sniper is no longer being shown.
Jalal says the movie doesn..È strike him as racist or anti-Arab. He says he finds the main character appealing regardless of the fact that he..È an American soldier killing Iraqis during the U.S.-led occupation of his home country.
...He was a hero and he went through difficult training,.. Jalal explained, saying Chris Kyle was just serving his country, a universal duty for all men. ...Besides,.. he shrugged, ...it..È just a movie, and I like war movies. If they are true or not, whatever!..

Who are they, these audacious gunmen? That..È now well enough known, as the suspects have been identified. Where are they? In the wind. On the run. Eluding, as of early Friday morning, a massive police dragnet concentrated around a rural village 80 kilometres northeast of here.

France has not given any indication of cracking open along fault lines of religious divisions. At the Place de la R.©publique, there were women wearing hijabs, warmly greeted. Although just-below-the-surface ruptures may shortly be bored open by the country..È far right politicians. ...Our culture was attacked,.. National Front leader Marine Le Pen, stated yesterday. ...War has been declared on our way of life...
Then she called for a referendum on the death penalty, which was abolished in France in 1981.
This is no war. This was a skirmish ... with obviously widely radiating repercussions ... as Islamic militants shift their operational tactics from the spectacular of 9/11 to smaller targeted missions that can engender just as much dread: the armed and fanatic lone wolf, or known wolf, as one of the brother suspects was convicted for aiding and abetting others to join jihadist movements, sentenced to 18 months in 2008.
This is however ... and despite the firm pronouncements of defiance ... a city of leeriness and confusion and anxiety.
Police sirens wail and it might be nothing or it could be something. Police vans burned rubber on the streets as rain fell all day in Paris. Hundreds of extra police and army troops have been added to the security ranks, yet another metropolis marked by the presence of the military in its midst ... 200 soldiers from parachute regiments across the country brought to the capital.
Security officials fear copycat attacks or a secondary ambush. Could it really be possible that the perpetrators of the Charlie Hebdo operation ... and it looks very much like an operation, carefully orchestrated, with a getaway plan attached ... would so carelessly leave a personal ID card in the vehicle they abandoned afterward, leading immediately and directly to the French-born brothers, and police releasing photos of the suspects: Cherif and Said Kouachi, 32 and 34? The brothers were born in eastern Paris to Algerian parents who died when the boys were still children. They grew up in an orphanage in the western city of Rennes.
Are they amateurs or trained jihadists?
While the enhanced security presence is necessary to protect Muslim places of worship as required ... at least two mosques attacked in France over the past 48 hours, as well as a kebab shop, though no injuries were reported ... the core fear is that this event was not plotted as a one-off. Or, even more chaotically and impossible to avert, that other like-minded malcontents will be inspired to launch their own assaults.
A fever pitch was hit Thursday morning when two police officers were gunned down in the southern Montrouge district of Paris by a man wearing a bulletproof vest, who fled. The female officer was killed. Last night, police were maintaining they did not believe the two events were linked but a second terrorism investigation was opened.
Nine people had been detained by late Thursday, though it..È unclear what their connection might be to either attack.

Police convoys carrying heavily armoured and masked anti-terrorism units raced to the scene around the villages of Corcy and Longpoint, holding journalists back four kilometres from the district of their sweep.
The fugitives had struck a service station nearby earlier in the day, robbing the operator of food and fuel, which further suggests they may not have been adequately prepared for an effective getaway. Some reports cast the men as operates of Al Qaeda in Yemen, others to the Islamic State. Both were definitely known to police and each had been on no-fly lists.
The helter-skelter nature of their escape is in marked contrast to the methodical orderliness of their butchery at Charlie Hebdo, where they attacked in the middle of the magazine..È weekly editorial meeting, apparently knowing in advance who would be in attendance and proceeding as if operating from a manifest list: calling out the names of those they intended to kill, shooting them in bursts, yet separating out some of the women, as one of the survivors told French magazine L..Èumanit.© afterward. Freelance reporter Sigolene Vinson, who..È gone in Wednesday to attend the editorial meeting around the old U-shaped wooded desk, said the men had spared her, one of them stating: ...I..È not killing you because you are a woman and we don..È kill women, but you have to convert to Islam...
All for cartoons, for parody of the prophet Muhammad that, as in Denmark before, aggrieved the righteously radical, Charlie Hebdo a thorn in the side of pious Muslims as it was to Christian evangelicals and right-wing French politicians and any other target that seized its gleeful imagination.

The cause was cancer, his wife, Lita, said. His death was not made public until this week.

Mr. Dior's logo was called ...a masterpiece of modern brand design... Credit Major League Baseball
As was customary with work-for-hire designs, Mr. Dior received no royalties for his baseball logo, and no public credit. He did not expect to (his is an inherently anonymous calling), nor did he expect his work to endure: Logos are ephemeral things, with clients inclined to revamp them every few years.

But this particular logo did endure. By 2008, as ESPN.com wrote that year, it had become ...a masterpiece of modern brand design.. that was ...more iconic and visible than ever...

Yet Mr. Dior, who had never thought to retain a documentary record of the assignment, remained unacknowledged. It was not money he longed for, he said, but the simple act of recognition.

...Every now and then I tell someone the story about the logo, and their eyes go gaga, and I say to myself, ...Hmm, do they really believe me or not?..È.. he told ESPN.com. ...I want some sort of foothold or something, so I can prove that I really did this...

Jerry Nicholas Dior was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1932; his mother was a homemaker, his father a dressmaker. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island and studied on scholarship at the Art Students League of New York. During the Korean War, he served stateside in the Army.

At Sandgren & Murtha, Mr. Dior was glad to land the M.L.B. assignment. A lifelong baseball fan, he adored the Dodgers until they traduced him by quitting Brooklyn in 1957, after which he threw his support to the Yankees.

Per his instructions, he drew a generic baseball player. (In interviews years later, Mr. Dior stressed that the figure was not modeled on Harmon Killebrew as many people, including Killebrew himself, believed.) He executed the design in Magic Marker, originally making it blue and green before switching to a patriotic palette.

...It just came to me,.. Mr. Dior told The Wall Street Journal in 2008. ...I did the rough sketch and cleaned it up a bit, and that was that. I never thought anything about it until I turned on the television and saw it on the New York Mets..Èuniforms,.. where it was emblazoned for the 1969 World Series.

Mr. Dior left Sandgren & Murtha shortly after designing the logo, and in later years he was a freelance graphic artist. But over time, especially as a string of professional sports logos, the National Basketball Association..È among them, were created as deliberate echoes of his design, the anonymity began to gnaw at him. He and his wife petitioned Major League Baseball for acknowledgment, to no avail.

Then, in 2008, The Journal profiled Mr. Dior, quoting former colleagues who attested to his authorship of the design. Other news organizations took up the story, creating a groundswell of support.

In 2009, after conducting its own inquiry, Major League Baseball officially recognized Mr. Dior as the logo..È creator, holding pregame ceremonies in his honor at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field.

...Jerry Dior created a symbol that has stood the test of time,.. Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, said in a statement that year. ...Forty years after its introduction, the ...silhouetted batter..Èis instantly recognized worldwide as the official emblem of Major League Baseball...

Besides his wife, the former Lita Zweier, Mr. Dior..È survivors include four children, Mitchell, Rick, Jed and Donna Dior, and four grandchildren.

...I don..È think he ever thought he would be recognized and celebrated the way he was,.. Mrs. Dior said of her husband in an interview on Friday. In 2009, Mr. Dior himself described the day he was first acknowledged as ...one of the most exciting days of my life...

In 2008, with recognition still eluding him, Mr. Dior was asked by ESPN.com how well he thought his logo had weathered the passing years.

...It holds up today as well as it did back then,.. he said. ...I truly feel it..È part of baseball. So I added a little something to the game, and I..È very proud of that...",,,,,,,,19.09,12.46,7.57,4.89,13.74,10.48,5.7,3.14,5.12,0.47,7.45,8.38,0.12,0.47,0.12,0,3.26,0,0

22,0,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. ... Louisville coach Rick Pitino has apparently said all he plans to say for now about the troubling allegations outlined in a book by an escort that has led to a sex scandal looming over his men's basketball program.

Pitino was mum about the allegations on Saturday, but questions continue to swirl after the online release of Katrina Powell's book, ""Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen."" The 104-page book was published by an affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal and is scheduled for release Oct. 12, though the publisher said it could be sooner.

Kate Snedeker, a spokeswoman for IBJ Book Publishing LLC, said that Powell is not doing interviews.

While Pitino and Powell aren't talking about the book, Louisville confirmed Friday it has been investigating her allegations that Andre McGee brought escorts to dorm parties and paid the women to dance and strip, and have sex with recruits and players. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to join the staff at Missouri-Kansas City, which has placed him on paid administrative leave.

McGee could not be reached for comment and messages left with his Louisville attorney, Scott Cox, have not been returned.

Pitino was questioned about the allegations again after Saturday's Red-White scrimmage, but repeatedly said his focus is on coaching.

""I'm just going to concentrate on basketball,"" Pitino said Saturday, adding that he has not read the book and has no plans to read it. ""When adversity hits, the strong survive. ... Idleness is what makes the mind wander, so the best thing I can do is work, work, work.""

The coach also doesn't want players talking about it. He said his current roster had nothing to do with the allegations and has instructed them not to discuss the situation.

""We told them it's not your concern,"" he said, ""and I've been told to coach basketball and not do anything else. Not get involved in this.""

Cardinals forward Mangok Mathiang said it's out of the players' control.

""All we're trying to focus on is the season coming up and the teams we're going to play,"" said the 6-foot-10 junior, who sat out the scrimmage with an eye injury. ""There's always going to be adversity and we've been through it plenty of times before.""

As for the investigation, Mathiang added: ""Whatever comes out, comes out.""

UMKC head coach Kareem Richardson is also trying to focus on basketball on his campus. The Louisville assistant from 2012-13 and McGee's current boss, did say the matter is a ""serious concern.""

""We all need to allow the process to run its course without interference,"" he added in a statement Saturday. ""In the meantime, our coaches and student-athletes are focused on academics and basketball as the season gets under way.""

Louisville has retained Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, which assists schools in NCAA cases, to review the allegations. It is unclear if university police have begun an investigation. The age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18.

University officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA.

Powell said in the book that during a four-year period many of the activities took place in the players' dormitory.

The book said that Powell brought women to 22 parties from 2010 to 2014 at Billy Minardi Hall, which houses Cardinals basketball players. The woman said that she and three of her daughters, along with other women, danced and stripped for Louisville recruits and players and performed sex acts with them.

The 43-year-old Powell also said McGee paid her $10,000 for the visits plus tips and offered recruits alcohol at those parties.

In the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door. The process evolved to the point where the escorts entered and left the building through the front entrance and had become familiar to staff.

McGee started 57 games at Louisville from 2005-09. He played professionally in Europe before becoming a program assistant in 2010, and he was promoted to director of basketball operations in 2012.

The publishing company said it paid investigators and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Dick Cady to vet Powell's story, and based much of it on journal entries, photos and text messages.

With the allegations engulfing he program, Louisville fans showed their support at Saturday's scrimmage for Pitino and his players, greeting them with cheers as they entered the court at the KFC Yum! Center.

""Everybody wants to band together,"" Mathiang said. ""We can't let nothing like this come between us.""",,,,,,,,18.48,9.15,4.9,4.25,15.08,16.24,5.8,2.45,1.93,0.52,5.67,5.28,0.26,0,0,0.13,3.35,0,1

23,0,"UNCASVILLE, Conn. ... After Elena Delle Donne was selected No. 2 in the 2013 W.N.B.A. draft, people wondered if she would fulfill the lofty expectations that accompanied such a distinction and become a transcendent player for a league continually fighting for recognition in American sports.

Griner..È teammate Diana Taurasi, often considered the best women..È basketball player in the world, is sitting out the W.N.B.A. season at the request of the Russian team she plays for during the winter. Other stars, like the 2014 most valuable player, Maya Moore, are consistent all-around threats, but no player has grabbed the mantle in Taurasi..È absence like Delle Donne, the leader of the Chicago Sky.

...I feel like I..Èe worked my entire life for opportunities like these,.. Delle Donne, 25, said. ...Obviously, there..È a ton of incredible players in the league that could step up any week, any month and be phenomenal. I..È comfortable in the role because I put in that much work. People who work this hard deserve things like that...

In her first two years with the Sky, the 6-foot-5 Delle Donne established herself as one of the best pure scorers in the W.N.B.A., averaging 18 points a game. This season, she leads the league in scoring at 24.5 points a game and is on pace to challenge Taurasi..È single-season scoring record of 860 points.

...She is deadly in that 15-foot area,.. San Antonio Stars guard Kayla McBride said. ...Her 3-point game and her rebounding on top of that? She..È averaging a double-double and making it look easy. You can throw double teams at her, whatever you want to try and get her out of her comfort zone, but it..È kind of hard to find where she..È not comfortable on the court...

One area where Delle Donne lacked proficiency in recent years was rebounding. Sky Coach Pokey Chatman challenged Delle Donne to improve her rebounding during the off-season.

Instead of competing overseas to earn extra money like a majority of W.N.B.A. players, Delle Donne stayed home and worked on her craft.

This season, she is averaging a career-high 9.8 rebounds a game, more than twice as many as last season. Delle Donne, who often plays guard, is second in the league in total rebounds (167), behind Tulsa Shock center Courtney Paris.

Chatman said she now entered every game believing she had the best player in the league on her roster in Delle Donne.

...I say that not against any other player,.. Chatman said. ...I..È aware of the things that she..È doing that may not show up on the stat sheet or highlights. She allows me to play five different defenses; she plays four different positions. That, to me, is what separates her...

Delle Donne experienced a turning point on June 24 in a 45-point effort against the Atlanta Dream. She displayed a full arsenal of offensive moves ... behind-the-back dribbles leading to up-and-under baskets in the post, crossover pull-up jumpers and finger-roll layups.

Watching Delle Donne that night, Dream guard Shoni Schimmel took note of how aggressive she had become in drawing contact and earning free throws. Delle Donne finished 19 for 19 from the foul line in the 100-96 overtime victory. This season, she has made 119 of 125 free throws.

...She..È the best,.. Dream forward Angel McCoughtry said. ...No one can guard her...

Delle Donne and Chatman credited the team..È new point guard, Cappie Pondexter, with adding a new level of confidence to Delle Donne..È catalog. Together, they have led the Sky to an 11-6 record and second place in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break.

...Her skill level is one of a kind,.. Pondexter said of Delle Donne.

For the first time in three years, Delle Donne is also playing without pain. She has been named an All-Star three times, and as a testament to her popularity among fans, she was the leading vote-getter twice, including this year. But she missed the 2013 and 2014 games because of concussion symptoms and ailments related to Lyme disease.

...I feel like more than anything, I..Èe been healthy this season,.. Delle Donne said.

With a clean bill of health, Delle Donne has ascended in becoming the league..È most recognizable player, replete with regular national television appearances.

Tamika Catchings, one of the league..È marquee players over the last decade, said Delle Donne had long possessed the basketball talent to be considered the best and now had to grow into accepting the public responsibility of representing an entire league.

Laurel J. Richie, the W.N.B.A. president, said she knew Delle Donne was going to be ...an incredible asset...

...I just feel like each year she comes into her own even more,.. Richie said. ...You think you..Èe at the peak level, and then she takes it up again. I think it..È great for the league.

25,0,"PHOENIX ... The N.F.L. will begin experimenting with streaming games worldwide next season as it searches for more broadcast revenue and ways to reach the growing number of consumers who do not pay for cable and satellite television.

The owners of the league..È 32 teams, who are holding their annual meeting here, were told that the Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game Oct. 25 in London would be available for free to viewers around the world.

The game will still be shown on television in the Buffalo and the Jacksonville markets. But by live-streaming the game on its website, the league will be able to bypass cable and satellite companies that traditionally take a cut of the revenue from broadcasting games.

The N.F.L., joining other content producers who are seeking to reach consumers directly, is looking for ways to reach consumers who do not have cable subscriptions.

...We..Èe testing alternative ways to distribute games,.. said Brian Rolapp, the executive vice president of media at the N.F.L.

He said that the league..È current model of showing games on network television remains solid, but there are millions of homes without pay television packages and that could accelerate.

...If the world ever changes, we want to be prepared,.. he said.

By streaming the game itself, the league can also reach fans in markets overseas where it is expensive to set up individual broadcast deals with local cable and satellite companies to carry games, according to Marc Ganis, a consultant to several N.F.L. teams. (An N.F.L. spokesman said the league was studying whether to hold the 2017 Pro Bowl in Brazil.)

Streaming games could also give the league more leverage with CBS, NBC and other networks when they negotiate television rights deals because the league would have the capability of showing more games itself, Ganis said.

The N.F.L. is still seeking an Internet distributor for the game, and that distributor is expected to keep the advertising revenue, Rolapp said. It is unclear whether the league will expand the number of games streamed and how soon, he added.

Separately, the league said that it would not black out games in local markets when teams failed to sell out their stadiums next season. This so-called blackout policy began in 1973 as a way to encourage fans to buy tickets to games rather than watch them free on television. Under the policy, a home game could be shown in a team..È local market if the game was sold out 72 hours in advance of kickoff.

As team ticket sales have improved, the number of games blacked out fell to zero last season and to two in 2013. The owners voted Monday to suspend the policy for the 2015 season and evaluate the results.

The N.F.L...È decision comes after the Federal Communications Commission in September repealed its sport blackout rules, which prohibited cable and satellite operators from importing the signal of a game when it was blacked out locally.

The F.C.C...È ruling did not affect the league..È ability to enforce its blackout policy through contractual arrangements.",,,,,,,,21.04,6.27,1.71,4.56,14.26,11.79,5.51,3.04,2.28,0.38,8.37,4.18,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,0

26,0,"The Blue Jays..Èmagic number has morphed into a Blue Jays magic moment.
The Jays are finally and officially guaranteed a spot in the playoffs for the first time in 22 long, painful seasons. And not just by some convoluted twist of permutations and combinations but by their play on the field.
Sure, it..È just the first step. Sure, the Jays are simply assured of a wild-card berth. There was champagne after the 10-8 win over the Rays on Saturday, that had waited, even though the numbers showed they had clinched even before David Price toed the rubber. But there is still work to be done. It was almost like a clubhouse celebration with training wheels, although for guys like Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, R.A. Dickey and manager John Gibbons, all veterans dancing for the first time, the moment had to be special.
The Jays will tell you the bar of their success will be set at nothing short of an AL East crown over the Yankees and, further, to first place overall, ahead of Kansas City, which would gain them home-field advantage throughout. Those are the magic numbers that will count as champagne-worthy.
But getting a foot in the door is a necessary and important first step that guarantees meaningful baseball games in October, in Toronto, for the first time since Joe Carter..È dramatic walk-off blast against Mitch Williams in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series accompanied by Tom Cheek..È magical call of ...Touch ..Èm all, Joe... Perspective? Jays closer Roberto Osuna was not yet born.
Simply by the numbers, the Jays played 22 seasons and 3,499 games, including Friday..È series opener against the Rays, without qualifying for the post-season. Sometimes I think it..È my fault. I began covering the Jays, writing columns on opening day of the 1995 schedule, a season that was delayed because of the late settlement of the 1994 strike by Sonia Sotomayor, now a Supreme Court justice, on the eve of what would have been an opening day for the Jays in Dunedin, Fla., with replacement players.
That..È a playoff-less drought of 20 seasons for the primary major-league team that I have been covering. In a previous life as media relations guy with the Montreal Expos, I spent 22 seasons with a team that earned a berth in just one post-season, the strike-interrupted 1981 campaign, advancing to within one win of playing the Yankees in the World Series. Other than that, 41 years of nada.
The following is a list of the only six seasons during that long playoff drought in which the Jays finished with a single-digit deficit in either the division or the wild-card race, six years in which they teased the fans and then backed away from the playoff table and failed again.
2000: Third place in the AL East, 4.5 games behind the Yankees. In manager Jim Fregosi..È second and final season, lefty David Wells spearheaded the rotation with 20 wins. The Jays finished behind the Yankees and Red Sox, but came as close as they had to winning the AL East. The Jays won four in a row in the third week of September to close within 4.5 games, but faded to 2-8 down the stretch to drop to third.
1998: Four games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The Yankees swept away the East with 11 wins, but the Jays battled the Red Sox for the wild card in manager Tim Johnson..È only season. This was the first time the Jays went large in this stretch adding DH Jose Canseco, catcher Darrin Fletcher and closer Randy Myers to an already powerful lineup and deep rotation. The proximity to the Sox was somewhat a mirage because the Jays won win six of seven in the final week to pull back to within four games.
2014: Five games behind the A..È for the wild card. The Jays had an opportunity to participate in the race last year with two wild cards up for grabs, but the Royals finished with 89 wins and the A..È with 88. The Jays were in year two of manager John Gibbons..Èsecond tour of duty, led by five pitchers with 11 or more wins and more solid work by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. The Jays were just 3.5 games behind the Royals on Sept. 17, then lost seven straight to make a strong finish after that meaningless.
2006: Eight games behind the Tigers for the wild card. This was Gibbons..Èfirst tour with the Jays and his best record as manager until this year, winning 87 games. Lefty B.J. Ryan notched 38 saves and Vernon Wells hit .303 with 32 homers and 106 RBIs. Third baseman Troy Glaus slammed 38 homers with 104 RBIs. Once again, this wild-card race was not as close as it seems, as the Tigers, who had 82 wins by Aug. 27, faded down the stretch and finished with 95 wins and the wild card, then went to the World Series.
2003: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. The best season for manager Carlos Tosca resulted in 86 wins, but a 15-game deficit to the Yankees and a nine-game gap to the wild-card Red Sox. Roy Halladay won 22 games and worked 266 innings, while Carlos Delgado and Wells combined for 75 homers and 262 RBIs. The Jays were 72-72 on Sept. 9 and charged hard down the stretch, going 14-4 to provide false home for the future. They were never close to the wild-card despite the numbers.
2008: Nine games behind the Red Sox for the wild card. Gibbons was fired in June while just four games under .500, replaced by Cito Gaston. The Jays responded to the familiar guidance of their World Series manager, learning to once again go to the plate with a plan, an approach. Halladay and A.J. Burnett combined for 38 wins, while Ryan had 32 saves. The Jays won 10 in a row in September to pull within seven games of the Red Sox, but were 8-10 in the final three weeks to finish comfortably out of it.
2015: Playoff bound. Finally the Jays are back in the playoffs, but with still more work to do to ensure the best possible seeding. Catcher Russell Martin has helped four different teams to the post-season in his first season with them ... the Dodgers (2006), the Yankees (2011), the Pirates (2013) and the Jays (2015).

Nick Kyrgios of Australia serves to Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland during second round of play at the Rogers Cup tennis tournament Wednesday August 12, 2015 in Montreal.

Kyrgios posted an apology Thursday on his Facebook page.
...I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the comments I made during the match last night vs Stan Wawrinka,.. he said. ...My comments were made in the heat of the moment and were unacceptable on many levels. In addition to the private apology I..Èe made, I would like to make a public apology as well. I take full responsibility for my actions and regret what happened...
The $10,000 fine is the maximum for incidents of verbal abuse or unsportsmanlike conduct.
The 30-year-old Wawrinka, ranked fifth in the world, announced in April that he had separated from his wife, with whom he has a daughter. The Swiss player has since been linked with 19-year-old Donna Vekic of Croatia, who is ranked 127th.
Vekic played mixed doubles with Kokkinakis, also 19 and ranked No. 76, at the 2014 Australian Open as a wild-card entry.
Kyrgios beat Wawrinka on Wednesday when the Swiss player retired with a lower-back injury while trailing 4-0 in the third set.
In a post-match interview on court, Kyrgios said Wawrinka had provoked him.
...He was getting a bit lippy at me so, I don..È know, it..È just in-the-moment sort of stuff,.. Kyrgios said. ...I don..È really know, I just said it...
Wawrinka..È coach, Magnus Norman, also criticized Kyrgios, who has been at the centre of controversy in recent weeks.
...That was really really low Nick Kyrgios,.. Norman wrote on Twitter. ...Hope for u that u have people around that will teach u a thing or 2 about life tonight. Very bad...
At Wimbledon last month, Kyrgios was booed by spectators in a fourth-round loss to Richard Gasquet of France. Kyrgios appeared to make little attempt to return Gasquet..È serve during the third game of the second set after a dispute with the chair umpire.
That incident prompted Australian swimming great Dawn Fraser to question the character of Kyrgios and suggest he could leave the country and return to where his parents came from.

The women..È K-4 500 team of Michelle Russell, Emilie Fournel, KC Fraser and Hannah Vaughan won Canada..È first gold of the Pan Am Games in the first medal event early Saturday morning in Welland, kickstarting an excellent day for the host nation.
The exuberance after the race was ...indescribable,.. Fraser said. The couple of minutes before it was anything but.
...When we paddle, our face is total agony, our lips are going sideways, our eyes are closed, we..Èe seeing stars,.. said Fournel, a 28-year-old Montrealer. ...And then within two seconds, this changes into a smile. You cross the line and you see you..Èe won. It..È a pretty incredible feeling.
...You get the stress feeling at the beginning of the race. The race goes and you get the crazy pain feeling, and then you cross the line and it..È total joy. It..È everything in two minutes...
Canada..È time of one minute 36.495 seconds was 1.17 seconds better than the second-place Cubans and 1.23 seconds in front of Argentina.
Being able to put the hosts on the medal board right off the bat was not only an accomplishment the women were proud of, but also a message to the rest of the 720-member Canadian contingent ... the country..È largest ever for a multi-sport Games.
With team officials setting a best-ever goal of a second-place finish, winning quickly may set a tone.
...I was a little bit nervous, but incredibly excited to be able to kick the Games off on the right note for Canada,.. said Vaughan. ...When you..Èe an athlete, you learn to use momentum to your advantage . . . in any sport, I think, and I hope this medal can help carry Canada through to the rest of the Games...
The robust, loud crowd at the Welland Flatwater Centre certainly helped generate some adrenaline among the women, who were competing at the most significant home event of their careers. They have trained and competed on the course since it opened, but Saturday was the first time they had a packed grandstand cheering them on.
...You just hear the crowd screaming so loud . . . and it just gives you that drive,.. said Fraser. ...It was like, ...Okay, I..È doing it for all of you...È..
And in Fournel..È case, one fan in particular stood out.
...There was a little kid and he was all shy,.. she said of the post-race celebration. ...He came to me and said, ...That was the best thing I..Èe seen in all my life,..Èand then he ran away.

30,0,"BALTIMORE...From a Kentucky horse farm to a sales ring in Saratoga to Bob Baffert..È barn at Santa Anita, American Pharoah gave every indication he..È a champion in the making.
So what if part of his tail is missing and he has cotton stuffed in his ears before races? To owner and breeder Ahmed Zayat, his Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness favourite is the horse of a lifetime.
...He is sheer brilliance and comes with unbelievable character,.. said Zayat, who was just warming up. ...He is a character. He is a horse that is kind, sweet, heady, classy, beautiful. It..È very rare to have a horse that has it all. He does everything as effortlessly as you can ever think...
In the months after the bay colt was foaled at Stockplace Farm, outside Lexington, Ky., on Feb. 2, 2012, then moved to Vinery farm, Zayat received glowing reports, particularly about the way he acted around other horses.
...Usually, when they are young, they..Èe silly, they hit each other and jump on each other like little kids,.. Zayat said. ...I kept getting told he..È acting so mature and confident, like ...I..È the leader of this group...È..
Right now, he..È leading many to believe he can win the Preakness on Saturday, set up a Triple Crown attempt in three weeks at the Belmont Stakes and end a record 37-year gap since Affirmed swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont.
...I am not going ahead of myself,.. Zayat said. ...We have to win the Preakness and have to see what happens before allowing myself to think of glory...
Zayat, who has spent millions on horses since diving headfirst into the business 10 years ago, also is proud American Pharoah is a homebred, a son of his Derby runner-up Pioneerof the Nile and grandson of another Derby runner-up, Empire Maker. His mother is a horse named for Zayat..È daughter, Emma, Littleprincessemma.
...A to Z, he is Zayat blood,.. the owner said of American Pharoah. ...His dad is the first horse I bred who won a Grade 1. It..È like saying your first team ever won the Super Bowl. And now he comes and wins the Derby and avenges the losses of his dad and grandfather?..
At Vinery, it was Frances Relihan, operations manager at the time, who told Zayat his colt stood out.
...She told me he is ...the best foal she ever saw,..È.. Zayat recalled. ...He was just showing tremendous leadership qualities...
And then it was on to Taylor Made, where the sales team convinced Zayat his colt could raise Pioneerof the Nile..È profile with breeders, owners and buyers.
So into the ring he went at the Fasig-Tipton Saratoga selected yearling sale, but with a caveat. Zayat would not sell for under $1 million. As it turned out, Zayat bought him back for $300,000.
On to Ocala, Fla., where American Pharoah learned how to be a racehorse. The breaking process went well, and Zayat called in trainers for his ...breeze show.. to showcase his latest crop.
Baffert immediately stated lobbying Zayat..È son Justin, the general manager of Zayat Stables.
...As soon as I saw this horse work on the farm, I sent him a video and Bob said to me, ...Justin, remember the Breeders..ÈCup is in California this year,.. Justin Zayat said. ...He wanted our horse. He saw how good he was from Day One. If you want to give a horse time to prepare for the Derby, you..Èe going to give him to Bob Baffert...
All did not go well when American Pharoah arrived in Baffert..È barn at Santa Anita. The colt, who, according to Zayat, lost part of his tail when Preakness rival Mr. Z bit it when they were in the field, was a sensitive sort. Distracted occasionally. It showed in his first race. Under Martin Garcia, he ran second most of the race, went wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch and finished fifth going 5 and a half furlongs at Del Mar.
Baffert went the cotton route for a fix ... cotton in the ears (earplugs if you will). It..È standard operating procedure before each race now. Not much acting up anymore, and no losses since.
With a new rider in Victor Espinoza, American Pharoah won the Del Mar Futurity and the FrontRunner Stakes with ease. He would have been the favourite for the Breeders..ÈCup Juvenile, but Baffert noticed something wrong ... a slight discomfort in the colt..È left front foot. American Pharoah missed the race, still was voted two-year-old champion and didn..È return to the races for nearly five and a half months.
...When he got hurt it was the most gut wrenching thing of my life,.. Justin Zayat said. ...When he came back it wasn..È a sigh of relief, it was more of just happiness to see him back, proud of him...
The comeback was a splashing success. He romped in the Rebel over a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, winning by 6 and one-quarter lengths. Then he clobbered the field by eight lengths in the Arkansas Derby three weeks before the Derby.
Sent off as the Derby favourite, American Pharoah struggled most of the way in third place, then fought for the lead coming out of the far turn. He overtook stablemate Dortmund, then outduelled Firing Line and won by a length. If nothing else, it showed American Pharoah could still win despite not running his best race.
...The sign of a great horse is one that has everything go against him and still wins,.. Ahmed Zayat said.
Baffert won..È argue. He loves what he sees.
...As always, he just floats over the track,.. the five-time Preakness winning trainer said Thursday after American Pharoah and stablemate Dortmund galloped around Pimlico Race Course for the first time. ...He..È a very sound and healthy horse. He just moves over the ground really well. He..È just brilliant. Does everything so effortlessly...

32,0,"Worried about what to worry about? Accidents should move higher up your list.

Worldwide, road injuries kill more people than AIDS. Falls kill nearly three times as many people as brain cancer. Drowning claims more lives than mothers dying in childbirth. Both fire and poisonings have many times more fatal victims than natural disasters. In 2013, the combined death toll from all unintentional injuries was 3.5 million people. Only heart disease and stroke were greater killers.

These findings, published late last year in the British medical journal The Lancet, are from the ...Global Burden of Disease.. study, an international collaboration led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which tracks the annual toll of 240 causes of death for men and women in 20 age groups across 188 countries. The study isn't mere morbid fascination. Look beneath the top-level results and you also see huge variations among countries that are economic peers. This is actually encouraging news: It means that some countries have figured out a much better way to curb accidental deaths ... and that other countries might be able to follow suit.

In France and Spain, according to the study..È authors, people die from transport injuries at roughly the same rate, but the French are twice as likely to die from falls, even when you adjust for the country..È older population. In Britain and the United States, deaths from falls are almost equivalent, but Americans are twice as likely to die from poisonings, again adjusted for age differences. Why?

If Russia could emulate Brazil, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from fire by 80 percent. If India could copy China, it would cut age-standardized deaths per capita from drowning by 30 percent. How?

The Global Burden of Disease study does not answer these questions directly, but it makes clear where to start looking for best practices. Individual countries can see in what areas they..Èe leading or lagging, often for the first time, then look to peers for advice or vice versa. Injury prevention may get one of the biggest boosts because global public health leaders have often ignored injuries as health risks, focusing instead on major diseases.

Take drowning. For decades, it has been one of the 20 biggest killers worldwide, but the World Health Organization issued its first report dedicated to drowning only in November 2014.

Effective prevention strategies include teaching swimming, providing life jackets, fencing off open water and training emergency medical responders. Drowning deaths also tend to decline as countries urbanize and when income and education increase. China, which both urbanized and started prevention programs, saw drowning deaths plunge from 190,000 in 1990 to 64,000 in 2013, Global Burden found. In India, drowning deaths barely budged, falling from an estimated 91,000 to 88,000 in the same period. David Meddings, an epidemiologist who was executive editor of the W.H.O. report, noted that China..È gains may partly reflect changes in the way deaths are reported, but that the improvement was still powerful.

...I don..È know why in India there has been economic development but drowning has not declined,.. Dr. Meddings said.

Progress in reducing the 237,000 global deaths a year from fire is equally variable. It makes sense that more Russians than Brazilians die from fire: Russia has fearsome winters, and many fires are caused by heaters. But climate does not explain why the age-standardized death rate from fire was halved between 1990 and 2013 in Brazil, according to Global Burden figures, while in Russia, where more than 10,000 people die every year from fire, it did not decline at all.

...Outdated infrastructure.. ... wooden buildings with barred windows and sparking heaters ... ...is the major cause,.. said Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow and a contributor to the new report. ...Every winter, we have had cases where small hospitals or rural facilities for aged people were destroyed by fire. Dozens of people died in one moment...

Show policy makers the larger data and what other countries are doing, Dr. Vlassov said, and there..È a better chance they will take appropriate action. ...For example,.. he said, ...in Russia, very strong legislation was introduced in relation to smoking almost two years ago. Smoking in public places almost disappeared...

Poisonings kill fewer people than drowning or fire worldwide ... about 98,000 in 2013 ... but are still a major health threat, claiming roughly 2,200 lives annually in the United States alone, according to Global Burden data. The puzzle is why the age-standardized death rate from poisonings in the United States is so much higher than in Britain.

...Is it because we have more availability of things that other countries have locked down?.. said Jay Schauben, a clinical toxicologist, director of the Florida/USVI Poison Information Center in Jacksonville, and president of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. ...Is it we sell things here that other countries have banned? Is it a difference in the health care system, or because people are afraid of seeking health care because of the cost, and therefore they stay at home and die? Is it a difference in the population and behavioral use patterns?..

Any one ... or all ... of these factors could explain the vastly different poisoning numbers, said Dr. Schauben, who is unaffiliated with the Global Burden of Disease study. So could disparate standards for reporting cause of death. ...How many of the unknown deaths do the medical examiners pursue down to the level of determining whether it..È a poisoning death?.. he said.

Dr. Schauben notes that international associations of clinical toxicologists meet together annually to compare protocols and patient outcomes, but that a comprehensive tally of national and international poisoning fatalities is new and that many poisoning victims never reach a hospital or poison control center. ...This is the first time I..Èe seen the death rates,.. he said. ...Poison centers only know about cases that are reported to us...

The Global Burden study exists, in part, to provide this kind of all-encompassing view of global, regional and national health, as well as to track progress or setbacks place by place, population by population. The project, which includes more than 1,000 scientists in 106 countries, began in the 1990s at the World Bank and World Health Organization and is now led by independent academic scientists with major funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

The new article in The Lancet is intended to be the first of a series of annual updates on death, disability and risk factors (like alcohol abuse, air pollution or lack of physical activity), providing the health equivalent of leading economic indicators. Where data on causes of death is sparse, the Global Burden team fills in the gaps as best it can with statistical modeling. The findings are therefore provisional ... the best available evidence, not the final word. Still, broad trends suggest that accident prevention continues to be neglected as a public health issue worldwide.

The largest category of fatal accidents is transport injuries. In 1990, according to Global Burden figures, these were the 10th-leading global killer. By 2013, they were fifth, ahead of malaria, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis or any kind of cancer. In part, this is because of progress against disease. But it also because as incomes have risen worldwide, more people are buying ... and crashing ... motorbikes and cars.

Research on transport injury prevention shows that collective action is as important as individual efforts. Motorcycle helmets, car seatbelts and sober drivers are important, but so are safe vehicles, consistent law enforcement and reliable infrastructure. At stake are the lives of more than 1.4 million people who die annually in transit.

The World Bank has made reducing transport deaths a major investment priority, and Michael Bloomberg is the leading philanthropist for global injury prevention efforts, as Bill Gates is for children..È vaccines. But no one tracks overall aid money to accident prevention, even though unintentional injuries cause 6.36 percent of global deaths.

If public health leaders are to catch up on accident prevention, the Global Burden of Disease study findings can help them see where and how.

34,0,"As complaints grow about exorbitant drug prices, pharmaceutical companies are coming under pressure to disclose the development costs and profits of those medicines and the rationale for charging what they do.

So-called pharmaceutical cost transparency bills have been introduced in at least six state legislatures in the last year, aiming to make drug companies justify their prices, which are often attributed to high research and development costs.

...If a prescription drug demands an outrageous price tag, the public, insurers and federal, state and local governments should have access to the information that supposedly justifies the cost,.. says the preamble of a bill introduced in the New York State Senate in May.

U.S. Shifts Stance on Drug Pricing in Pacific Trade Pact Talks, Document RevealsJUNE 10, 2015
The New Health Care: With Sickest Patients, Cost Sharing Comes at a PriceMAY 4, 2015
In an article being published Thursday, more than 100 prominent oncologists called for support of a grass-roots movement to stem the rapid increases of prices of cancer drugs, including by letting Medicare negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies and letting patients import less expensive medicines from Canada.

...There is no relief in sight because drug companies keep challenging the market with even higher prices,.. the doctors wrote in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. ...This raises the question of whether current pricing of cancer drugs is based on reasonable expectation of return on investment or whether it is based on what prices the market can bear...

Pressure is mounting from elsewhere as well. The top Republican and Democrat on the United States Senate Finance Committee last year demanded detailed cost data from Gilead Sciences, whose hepatitis C drugs, which cost $1,000 a pill or more, have strained the budgets of state and federal health programs. The U.A.W. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust tried to make Gilead, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Celgene and other companies report to their shareholders more about how they set prices and the risks to their businesses from resistance to high drug prices.

The trust cited the more than $300,000 per year price of Vertex..È cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and roughly $150,000 for Celgene..È cancer drug Revlimid.

Even former President Bill Clinton, in a speech to pharmaceutical executives in Philadelphia last month, said it would be in the industry..È best interest to say more about its costs and pricing.

...Explain, explain, explain and disclose, disclose, disclose,.. Mr. Clinton said, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. ...Don..È expect everybody to love you, but at least they will hear your side of the story...

The pharmaceutical industry has already had the veil lifted on various practices. Drug companies now have to report the payments, including meals and entertainment, that they make to doctors for research, consulting and giving promotional speeches. The companies have also had to disclose more results of their clinical trials and in some cases have started to provide raw data to outsiders.

It is unclear if cost and pricing will become the next such area. The state bills, which are supported by some health insurers and consumer groups, have not progressed. The two senators, Republican Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, have not reported the results of their inquiry. And shareholders of Gilead, Vertex and Celgene voted down the resolutions proposed by the U.A.W. trust, though the trust says it reached settlements with Eli Lilly and with two other drug companies it would not identify.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry trade groups say the transparency bills would be costly to comply with and would provide misleading information.

Even some people concerned about drug prices say that the cost to develop a particular drug has little to do with that drug..È price and that knowing such information will not keep prices down.

...The past R&D cost is really kind of a red herring,.. said Len Nichols, a health care economist at George Mason University, referring to research and development. ...The current revenue doesn..È pay for past R&D; it pays for current R&D...

Prices for cancer drugs, some of which extend lives by only a couple of months, routinely exceed $100,000 a year, and some new ones exceed $150,000. And it is not unusual for the list prices of existing drugs to rise 10 percent or more year after year, far beyond the rate of inflation. The prices of older drugs for multiple sclerosis have risen from about $10,000 per year in the late 1990s to more than $60,000 now, according to a study, even as competition in the market has intensified with the introduction of new products.

Cost transparency bills have also been introduced in California, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

Three of the bills require disclosures for drugs costing $10,000 or more per year. The others have different criteria. Besides development costs, some of the bills would require disclosure of the costs of manufacturing, marketing and advertising. At least some of the bills also ask for a history of price increases, the profit attributable to the drug and how much a company spends in providing financial assistance to patients using the drug.

Two of the bills would allow the states to act on the information, not just require disclosure. Pennsylvania..È would allow insurers to refuse to pay for a drug if the manufacturer did not file the required report. In Massachusetts, a state commission would be able to set a maximum price for a drug if it determined that the price set by the manufacturer was significantly high compared with the benefits, costs or prices in other countries.

Most of the bills have not been acted upon, though hearings were held in California and Oregon.

The sponsor of the California bill, Assemblyman David Chiu, pulled it back shortly before a committee was to vote on it, apparently because it did not have sufficient support. The bill could be picked up again next year.

...This is a new topic for many of my colleagues to grapple with,.. said Mr. Chiu, a Democrat from San Francisco. He said the bill was necessary because ...greater transparency leads to better policy results...

Mitch Greenlick, a Democrat from Portland who is chairman of the Health Care Committee in Oregon..È House of Representatives, said the bill was prepared with input from the health insurance industry, but was ...not ready for prime time... He added that the issue would be further studied.

...What are we going to do with that information?.. he said. ...It..È interesting to have, I suppose, but the drug companies are shameless, and they charge what they can get away with...

Insurers and consumer groups told the Oregon Legislature that more disclosure was needed because the state had to decide whether to pay for certain drugs. Representatives of the pharmaceutical industry said the bill was unfair and would discourage industry investment in Oregon.

Lori Reilly, executive vice president for policy and research at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry..È main trade group, said it was misleading to look only at the cost of developing a particular drug because that ignored the money spent on the drugs that fail during development. Only about 12 percent of drugs tested in people reach the market, she said.

Ms. Reilly said that publicly traded drug companies already disclosed their overall research and development costs, as well as other financial information. She also said that focusing on costs ignored the value of the drugs. Some drugs, for instance, can save money for the health system over all by keeping people out of the hospital, she said.

Pharmaceutical executives do not typically tie the price of any particular drug to its development cost. But they do say that their sales have to recoup their investment in research and development if the companies are to stay in business.

They often cite the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, which last year said companies spent an average of $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market, up from an estimate of $800 million in 2003. That includes the cost of failures. And almost half the figure is opportunity cost, the amount a company might have earned if it had invested money elsewhere rather than spending it on drug development.

Critics are skeptical of that figure, saying that the Tufts center gets funding from the pharmaceutical industry and uses data supplied by the drug companies, but does not disclose which drugs are used as the basis of the estimates.

Pharmaceutical executives often say they price the drugs based on the value they provide, though often a detailed explanation of that is not provided. In many cases, it appears, the price of new drugs is set in comparison to rival drugs already on the market, and usually a bit higher. Companies then can raise their prices for the older drugs.

...We all look at each other and keep pace with each other,.. said a director of one multiple sclerosis drug developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ...Honestly, there is no science to it...

...The industry has used R&D costs for the justification, but anyone who is reasonably sophisticated understands those are sunk costs and have little to do with pricing,.. Mr. Rother said. ...The more important information is any calculation of value.

35,0,"After decades of worsening diets and sharp increases in obesity, Americans..Èeating habits have begun changing for the better.
Calories consumed daily by the typical American adult, which peaked
around 2003, are in the midst of their first sustained decline since federal
statistics began to track the subject, more than 40 years ago. The number of
calories that the average American child takes in daily has fallen even more ...
by at least 9 percent.
The declines cut across most major demographic groups ... including
higher- and lower-income families, and blacks and whites ... though they vary
somewhat by group.
In the most striking shift, the amount of full-calorie soda drunk by the
average American has dropped 25 percent since the late 1990s.
As calorie consumption has declined, obesity rates appear to have stopped
rising for adults and school-aged children and have come down for the
youngest children, suggesting the calorie reductions are making a difference.
The reversal appears to stem from people..È growing realization that they
were harming their health by eating and drinking too much. The awareness
began to build in the late 1990s, thanks to a burst of scientific research about
the costs of obesity, and to public health campaigns in recent years.
The encouraging data does not mean an end to the obesity epidemic:
More than a third of American adults are still considered obese, putting them
at increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Americans are still
eating far too few fruits and vegetables and far too much junk food, even if
they are eating somewhat less of it, experts say.
But the changes in eating habits suggest that what once seemed an
inexorable decline in health may finally be changing course. Since the mid-
1970s, when American eating habits began to rapidly change, calorie
consumption had been on a near-steady incline.
...I think people are hearing the message, and diet is slowly improving,..
said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition
Science and Policy at Tufts University.
Barry Popkin, a University of North Carolina professor who has studied
food data extensively, described the development as a ...turning point.
There is no perfect way to measure American calorie consumption. But
three large sources of data about diet all point in the same direction. Detailed
daily food diaries tracked by government researchers, data from food bar
codes and estimates of food production all show reductions in the calories
consumed by the average American since the early 2000s. Those signals, along
with the flattening of the national obesity rate, have convinced many public
health researchers that the changes are meaningful.
The eating changes have been the most substantial in households with
children. Becky Lopes-Filho..È 4-year-old son, Sebastian, has always been at
the top of the growth chart for weight. Ms. Lopes-Filho, 35, is the operations
manager of a pizzeria in Cambridge, Mass., and her son, like her, loves food.
As he has gotten older, she has grown more concerned about his cravings for
sweets. Instead of a cookie every day now, she said, she has been trying to limit
him to one a week. ...If he was given access, he would just go nuts,.. she said.
...He, I think, would tend to be a super obese kid...
There is no single moment when American attitudes toward eating
changed, but researchers point to a 1999 study as a breakthrough. That year,
researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a
paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association that turned into
something of a blockbuster.
The paper included bright blue maps illustrating worsening obesity rates
in the 1980s and 1990s in all 50 states. Researchers knew the obesity rate was
rising, but Dr. Ali Mokdad, the paper..È lead author, said that when he
presented the maps at conferences, even the experts were gasping. A year
later, he published another paper, with a similar set of maps, showing a related
explosion in diabetes diagnoses. ...People became more aware of it in a very
visual and impactful way,.. said Hank Cardello, a former food industry
executive who is now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
policy center. ...That created a lot of attention and concern...
Shortly afterward, the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher, issued a report
... ...Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.. ...
modeled on the famous 1964 surgeon general..È report on tobacco. The 2001
report summarized the increasing evidence that obesity was a risk factor for
several chronic diseases, and said controlling children..È weight should be a
priority, to prevent the onset of obesity-related illnesses.
Slowly, the messages appear to have sunk in with the public. By 2003, 60
percent of Americans said they wanted to lose weight, according to Gallup, up
from 52 percent in 1990 and 35 percent in the 1950s.
The Obama administration has increased pressure. The Affordable Care
Act, passed in 2010, required chain restaurants to publish the calorie content
of their meals. The federal government has also changed requirements,
making school lunches healthier, although the effort has created some
backlash.
Several cities have gone further. Philadelphia subsidizes produce
purchases for the poor. New York limits the kind of food available in day care
centers. Berkeley, Calif., last year became the first city in the United States to
tax sugar-sweetened beverages. The evidence for the effectiveness of these
interventions is mixed, but their popularity reflects public health officials..Èemphasis on diet and obesity.
Still, the timeline of the calorie declines suggests that people started
eating a little less before policy makers got involved. That follows the pattern
for tobacco use, which peaked right around the time of the 1964 surgeon
general..È report. The policy changes that many credit with the country..È sharp
reductions in smoking ... advertising bans, warning labels, taxes and
restrictions on smoking in public ... came later, accelerating change after
attitudes had already begun to shift.
The anti-obesity public health campaigns have focused on one subject
more than any other: beverages.
Anti-soda messages hit their target. Americans, on average, purchased
about 40 gallons of full-calorie soda a year in 1998, according to sales data
from the industry trade publication Beverage Digest analyzed by the Center for
Science in the Public Interest. That fell to 30 gallons in 2014, about the level
that Americans bought in 1980, before the obesity rates took off.
...I think the attitude more and more in this country is that it..È not a good
idea to consume a lot of soda,.. said Dr. Satcher, now a professor at the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.
Beverage companies have reacted by marketing diet drinks and investing
heavily in new products, including iced teas and flavored water. ...A lot of the
changes we are seeing are consumer-driven,.. said John Sicher, Beverage
Digest..È publisher.
Outside of beverages, there are few clear trends. Experts who have
examined the data say the reductions do not mean that Americans are flocking
to farmer..È markets and abandoning fast food. Consumption of fruits and
vegetables remains low; consumption of desserts remains high. Instead,
people appear to be eating a little less of everything. Although consumption in
nearly every category has been ...cut some,.. said Mr. Popkin, ...the food part of
our diet is horrendous and remains horrendous...
The calorie reductions are seen across nearly every demographic group,
but not equally. White families have reduced their calorie consumption more
than black and Hispanic families. Most starkly, families with children have cut
back more than households with adults living alone, further evidence, experts
say, that the public health emphasis on childhood obesity is driving the
changes.
Ms. Lopes-Filho said she..È seen how her concern about her son..È diet has
subtly changed her own eating habits. ...I think I..È still sneaking stuff behind
his back, but I have tried to change,.. she said. ...I haven..È been drinking soda or
doing a lot of sugary drinks in a while, but all because of him ... because I know
that if I have it, he..È going to want it. And there..È really no fair way to say, ...No,
this is Mommy..È drink...È..
Perhaps the biggest caveat to the trend is that it does not appear to extend
to the very heaviest Americans. Among the most overweight people, weight
and waist circumference have all continued rising in recent years.
The recent calorie reductions appear to be good news, but they, alone, will
not be enough to reverse the obesity epidemic. A paper by Kevin Hall, a
researcher at the National Institutes of Health, estimated that for Americans
to return to the body weights of 1978 by 2020, an average adult would need to
reduce calorie consumption by 220 calories a day. The recent reductions
represent just a fraction of that change.
...This was like a freight train going downhill without brakes,.. Kelly
Brownell, dean of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, said.
...Anything slowing it down is good...

36,0,"When Olympian Clara Hughes agreed to speak publicly for the first time in 2010 about her experience with depression, she wasn..È sure anyone would care. But one of the people closest to Hughes didn..È know about her struggle more than 10 years after she sought help.
...My mother found out on TV,.. said Hughes, 42.
Hughes, one of few athletes who have competed in both the summer and Winter Olympics, became a spokesperson for Bell in 2010, when the company announced it was committing $50 million to mental health initiatives.
...I had such a hard time with it that I didn..È talk to her for three months after the campaign because I felt so bad that I hadn..È told her,.. said Hughes, who..Èl be in Toronto on Tuesday for a screening of a documentary about her epic 2010 cycling journey to raise the problem..È profile.
A history of mental illness in her family is what kept Hughes from sharing her diagnosis with her mother. Hughes..Èsister suffered from bipolar disorder and depression while her father struggled with addiction. With her mother was trying to manage it all, Hughes said she didn..È want to be a burden.
While training as a cyclist in the mid-1990s, Hughes started to sink into depression, although she didn..È call it that at the time.
...No matter what I won, I still had this void and darkness and often times feelings of self-loathing and worthlessness inside,.. she said.
Even after bringing home two bronze medals from the Atlanta summer games in 1996, the feelings persisted and Hughes spiralled into depression for the next two years. At a training camp the winter after returning from Atlanta, a national team doctor talked to Hughes about depression and suggested ways to get help.
...I walked out the meeting thinking, you..Èe not going to tell me what..È wrong with me, there..È nothing wrong with me. I..È a great athlete, I..Èl get through this ... I..Èl just train harder,.. she said.
But the reality was she couldn..È focus ... barely able to race her bike and crashing it when she did.
...I was in such a fog,.. said Hughes.
When she finally sought support, it was there for her but she realizes not everyone is so lucky. That..È why she decided to speak up about her own struggle after hearing that Bell, a sponsor for many years, was launching a charitable campaign focusing on mental illness in 2010.
She hopes having more public figures come forward with their experiences with mental illness will help more ...real people.. share their stories.
Last year, Hughes completed a cycling journey spanning 110 days and covering more than 11,000 kilometres across Canada to bring more attention to the issue. The documentary on the ride, Clara..È Big Ride, will be aired on CTV on Bell Let..È Talk day, on Wednesday.
One day of the year, Bell adds five cents to existing funds dedicated to mental illness programs for every text message and mobile and long distance call made by Bell customers. A year after its launch, the company included social media as part of the campaign to let those who didn..È have Bell phones participate.
Since the first Let..È Talk day in 2011, $17.5 million has been added to the pot, totalling a $67.5 million commitment from Bell.
...Mental health as a sector has been, I believe, underfunded systematically forever,.. said chair of the initiative, Mary Deacon.
Bell has spent about $10 million a year of that money supporting over 250 organizations across the country ... from psychiatric units in hospitals to community-based programs, according to Deacon.
Dismantling stigma is high on her agenda.
...The more we talk as individuals and communities, the more this will become a priority issue for action,.. Deacon said.
But talking is not always as easy as it seems, even for Olympians. Hughes said when she finally faced her mother, she simply asked Hughes why she didn..È tell her before.
...One of the biggest regrets that I have is not talking to my mom about it and letting her support me,.. said Hughes.",,,,,,,,22.03,12.45,8.35,4.1,16.4,14.79,4.98,4.25,6.3,2.2,4.54,6.15,0,0,0,0,2.64,0,0

According to Sprout, HSDD affects up to one in 10 American women. It..È characterized as an unexplained persistent lack of sexual thoughts, fantasies, responsiveness and desire to engage in sex, which causes personal distress.
Addyi, which is taken daily, can cause severely low blood pressure and loss of consciousness ... risks that increase if consumed with alcohol or certain medicines. Common adverse reactions include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, fatigue, insomnia and dry mouth.
FDA approval was, in part, based on three randomized trials involving about 2,400 premenopausal women with HSDD. On average, Addyi boosted the number of ...satisfying sexual events.. from 0.5 to one additional event per month, as compared with those who took the placebo.
The drug has overcome numerous hurdles, opposition and criticism. It was rejected by the FDA as a desire drug in 2010 and 2013. Then Sprout and other drug companies with sexual pharmaceuticals in the pipeline sponsored the campaign Even the Score. It resembled a grassroots, social media campaign accusing the FDA of sexism for not having approved this drug for women, while claiming men had similar drugs to help them treat male sexual dysfunction.
...Even the Score. . . It..È time to level the playing field when it comes to the treatment of women..È sexual dysfunction,.. reads the campaign..È website.
Thea Cacchioni, an assistant professor of women..È studies at the University of Victoria who testified before the FDA in 2010 and was critical of the drug, suspects public pressure influenced the agency..È most recent decision. In addition to Even the Score, there was compelling testimony at the most recent FDA hearing.
...There were many patients and doctors, who were sponsored by Sprout, and they gave very emotional pleas and spoke a lot about the demand for the drug,.. Cacchioni said in an interview. ...The FDA panel members barely had anything positive to say about the drug...
Cacchioni has been studying the race by pharmaceutical companies to launch a sexual drug for women for years and recently published the book Big Pharma, Women, and the Labour of Love.
She doesn..È believe that the benefits of Addyi, when weighed against its risks, have been proven, particularly when compared with the benefits of sex therapy, sex education and sex counselling. She..È also concerned that the drug was tested on a young and healthy population ... the average age of the participants in the trials was 36 ... saying ...we don..È know what a drug is really going to do until it goes out into a wider population...
Her comments are echoed, in part, by Cassels. ...When you take a drug and give it to healthy people, you have to be absolutely certain that drug is not going to have any adverse effect. And, in the clinical studies of this drug, we..Èe seen that there are people being harmed by it...
Cassels, who along with Ray Moynihan co-wrote Selling Sickness: How the World..È Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies Are Turning Us All Into Patients, believes the industry has created disorders, such as HSDD, in an effort to market drugs.
...The main hurdle (for approval) was to try and define the disease,.. Cassels said. ...And I think (Sprout) bamboozled the FDA into considering this a disease...
Cassels said it..È a misnomer to refer to Addyi as the female Viagra or pink Viagra because Viagra has nothing to do with desire. Rather, it..È aimed at increasing blood flow to the genitals for men.
At the extreme end, he believes there are women who aren..È interested in having sex. But Cassels suspects that..È not who the drug maker will target.
...This drug will be marketed to everyone who doesn..È want to have sex, for whatever reason ... the ...Not tonight, honey, I have a headache..Èmarket.
...The market has been shaped around turning lack of desire into a disease and I think it..È highly problematic,.. Cassels said.

41,0,"WASHINGTON ... President Obama on Tuesday rejected an attempt by lawmakers to force his hand on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, using his veto pen to sweep aside one of the first major challenges to his authority by the new Republican Congress.

With no fanfare and a 104-word letter to the Senate, Mr. Obama vetoed legislation to authorize construction of a 1,179-mile pipeline that would carry 800,000 barrels of heavy petroleum a day from the oil sands of Alberta to ports and refineries on the Gulf Coast.

In exercising the unique power of the Oval Office for only the third time since his election in 2008, Mr. Obama accused lawmakers of seeking to circumvent the administration..È approval process for the pipeline by cutting short ...consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest...

By rejecting the legislation, Mr. Obama retains the right to make a final judgment on the pipeline on his own timeline. But he did little to calm the political debate over Keystone, which has become a symbol of the continuing struggle between environmentalists and conservatives.
 
Backers of the pipeline denounced Mr. Obama..È actions and vowed to keep fighting for its construction.

The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, called the president..È veto ...a national embarrassment.. and accused Mr. Obama of being ...too close to environmental extremists.. and ...too invested in left-fringe politics...

Environmentalists quickly hailed the decision, which they said clearly indicated Mr. Obama..È intention to reject the pipeline..È construction. The White House has said the president will decide whether to allow the pipeline when all of the environmental reviews are completed in the coming weeks.

...Republicans in Congress continued to waste everyone..È time with a bill destined to go nowhere, just to satisfy the agenda of their big oil allies,.. said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. ...The president has all the evidence he needs to reject Keystone XL now, and we are confident that he will...

Since 2011, the proposed Keystone pipeline has emerged as a broader symbol of the partisan political clash over energy, climate change and the economy.

Most energy policy experts say the project will have a minimal impact on jobs and climate. But Republicans insist that the pipeline will increase employment by linking the United States to an energy supply from a friendly neighbor. Environmentalists say it will contribute to ecological destruction and damaging climate change.

Mr. Obama has hinted that he thinks both sides have inflated their arguments, but he has not said what he will decide.

In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Obama urged lawmakers to move past the pipeline debate, calling for passage of a comprehensive infrastructure plan. ...Let..È set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,.. he said.

Republican leaders had promised to use the veto, which was expected, to denounce Mr. Obama as a partisan obstructionist. They made good on that promise minutes after the president..È veto message was read on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday.

...The fact he vetoed the bipartisan Keystone Pipeline in private shows how out of step he is with the priorities of the American people, who overwhelmingly support this vital jobs and infrastructure project,.. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.

In recent months, the environmental activists ... who have spent years marching, protesting and getting arrested outside the White House in their quest to persuade Mr. Obama to reject the project ... have said they are increasingly optimistic that their efforts will succeed.

...Hopefully the ongoing legislative charade has strengthened his commitment to do the right thing,.. said Bill McKibben, a founder of the group 350.org, which has led the campaign to urge Mr. Obama to reject the pipeline.

The debate began in 2008, when the TransCanada Corporation applied for a permit to construct the pipeline. The State Department is required to determine whether the pipeline is in the national interest, but the last word on whether the project will go forward ultimately rests with the president.

Mr. Obama has delayed making that decision until all the legal and environmental reviews of the process are completed. He has said a critical factor in his decision will be whether the project contributes to climate change.

more carbon pollution than conventionally extracted oil.

But the review said the pipeline was unlikely to contribute to a significant increase in planet-warming greenhouse gases because the fuel would probably be extracted from the oil sands and sold with or without construction of the pipeline.

This month, environmentalists pointed to a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency that they said proved that the pipeline could add to greenhouse gases.

The question of whether to build the pipeline comes as Mr. Obama hopes to make climate change policy a cornerstone of his legacy. This summer, the E.P.A. is expected to issue sweeping regulations to cut greenhouse gas pollution from power plants, a move experts say would have vastly more impact on the nation..È carbon footprint than construction of the Keystone pipeline.

In December, world leaders hope to sign a global United Nations accord in Paris that would commit every nation in the world to enacting plans to reduce its rates of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. In the coming months, countries are expected to begin putting forward those policies for cutting carbon emissions.

While the Keystone pipeline is not expected to be part of the United States climate change plan, a public presidential decision on the project could be interpreted as a message about Mr. Obama..È symbolic commitment to the issue of climate change.

Until that decision is made, however, both sides of the Keystone fight are stepping up their tactics. Environmental groups are planning more marches and White House petitions, while Republicans in Congress are looking for ways to bring the Keystone measure back to Mr. Obama..È desk.

Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who sponsored the Keystone bill, said he would consider adding language requiring construction of the pipeline to other legislation, such as spending bills to fund federal agencies, which could make a veto far more politically risky for Mr. Obama.

A final decision by the president could come soon. Last month, a court in Nebraska reached a verdict in a case about the pipeline..È route through the state, clearing the way for construction. And this month, final reviews of the pipeline by eight federal agencies were completed.

However, Mr. Obama is under no legal obligation to make a final decision, and there is no official timetable for a decision. He could approve or deny the project at any time ... or leave the decision to the next president.",,,,,,,,24.87,5.9,3.04,2.86,15.19,11.17,4.02,1.88,3.75,1.61,5.81,4.65,0,0,0,0,1.61,0,0

43,0,"WASHINGTON ... In the early months of 2014, a group of about 30 corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists and Republican political strategists began meeting regularly in the headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, often, according to some of the participants, in a conference room overlooking the White House. Their task was to start devising a legal strategy for dismantling the climate change regulations they feared were coming from President Obama.

The group ... headed in part by Roger R. Martella Jr., a top environmental official in the George W. Bush administration, and Peter Glaser, a prominent Washington lobbyist ... was getting an early start.

By the time Mr. Obama announced the regulations at the White House on Monday, the small group that had begun its work at the Chamber of Commerce had expanded into a vast network of lawyers and lobbyists ranging from state capitols to Capitol Hill, aided by Republican governors and congressional leaders. And their plan was to challenge Mr. Obama at every opportunity and take the fight against what, if enacted, would be one of his signature accomplishments to the Supreme Court.

Within minutes of the announcement, West Virginia..È attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, stepped before a bank of cameras for a news conference at the Greenbrier resort in his home state. Flanked by Mike Duncan, the president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, one of the nation..È top coal lobbying groups, and Greg Zoeller, the attorney general of Indiana, Mr. Morrisey announced that a group of at least 15 Republican state attorneys general were preparing to jointly file a legal challenge to Mr. Obama..È proposal.

...The final rule announced Monday blatantly disregards the rule of law and will severely harm West Virginia and the U.S. economy,.. Mr. Morrisey said. ...This rule represents the most far-reaching energy regulation in this nation..È history, drawn up by radical bureaucrats and based on an obscure, rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act...

...Our coalition, in short order, will comprise of many states, consumers, mine workers, coal operators, utilities and businesses who are united in opposition to this radical and illegal policy,.. he added.

While Mr. Obama had not even put forth a draft proposal of his plans when the group started its work, the president had made plain in several speeches that he intended to act forcefully on climate change ... and that he would flex the muscle of his executive authority to do so. ...If Congress won..È act soon to protect future generations, I will,.. he said in his 2013 State of the Union address. The lawyers and lobbyists wanted to be ready to fire back hard and fast when he did.

In devising its strategy, the group worked closely with the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader whose coal-producing home state also stands to suffer under the regulation. While Mr. McConnell opposes the climate change regulations, his advisers knew that he had little chance of enacting legislation to block them in Congress. Instead, Mr. McConnell has taken the unusual step of reaching out directly to governors and attorneys general, urging them to refuse to submit compliance plans for the regulations, and encouraging a state-by-state rejection of the rules.

Mr. Morrisey, whose coal-producing home state is also struggling with the nation..È highest unemployment rate, was chosen as the public face of the suit. But key strategists joining the original planning were Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a former attorney general there, and Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma. Both already had experience suing the Obama administration over major Clean Air Act regulations.

An important ally in the effort was the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative advocacy group that pushes policy through state legislatures. Typically, the council..È committees of corporate members will craft a model bill designed to push through policies it supports, such as rolling back environmental regulations.

At a July meeting in San Diego, ALEC..È energy committee ... which includes Mr. Duncan, the coal lobbyist who also worked closely with Mr. McConnell on his tactics ... enacted a model bill designed to directly support state attorneys general who legally challenge the climate change plan. According to a person present at that July meeting, the bill would allow states to create funds, which could be funded by corporate donations, to support legal challenges to the climate change rules.

While it is not unusual for major corporations to sue the federal government over environmental regulations, people involved in the effort to craft a legal strategy against the climate change rules said the time, labor and coordination of the effort were unusual. That effort reflects the sweeping scope of climate change regulations, which, unless struck down in the Supreme Court, could transform huge sectors of the economy, potentially crippling the coal industry and other industrial sectors whose economic well-being relies on coal.

The Obama administration contends that despite the massive scale of the challenges trained against it, the climate change plan is legally sound. ...The final rule is built on a rock-solid legal foundation,.. said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency.

...E.P.A. is using its clear authority under the Clean Air Act to set emission standards for air pollutants,.. he said. ...The rule is wholly consistent with the law, and we are confident it will withstand any and all legal challenges...

But Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who has worked closely with the group, says that the attorneys general will not back down. ...This rule was more aggressive than any of us could have imagined,.. he said. ...There is no lack of state attorneys general who would like to put a bullet in this thing... The rules, a final, stricter version of a plan that the Environmental Protection Agency announced in 2012 and 2014, assigns each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants. States will be allowed to create their own plans to meet the requirements and will have to submit initial versions of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018.

The most aggressive of the regulations requires that by 2030, the nation..È existing power plants must cut emissions by 32 percent from 2005 levels, which is an increase from the 30 percent target proposed in the draft regulation.

The president on Monday called the new rules a public health imperative and ...the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change... He also sought to wrap the policy in the legitimacy of transcendental values, noting that Pope Francis issued an encyclical in June, calling action on the issue a ...moral obligation...

Even as Mr. Obama acknowledged the steep resistance from coal-producing states and industry critics, he said it was up to the United States to adopt tough standards so that other countries like China would feel compelled to take similar steps.

But Mr. McConnell made it clear he would do everything in his power to combat the rules, which he said the president had crafted because he was ...tired of having to work with the Congress the people elected...

...That..È why the administration is now trying to impose these deeply regressive regulations ... regulations that may be illegal, that won..È meaningfully impact the global environment, and that are likely to harm middle- and lower-class Americans most ... by executive fiat,.. Mr. McConnell said. ...It represents a triumph of blind ideology over sound policy and honest compassion,.. he added.",,,,,,,,27.67,7.07,2.73,4.34,14.3,9.56,4.18,2.33,4.66,1.04,5.3,6.43,0,0,0,0,2.25,0,0

44,0,"Parts of the eastern United States, already hit by heavy rains that have caused flooding, prepared on Thursday for even more rain as Hurricane Joaquin churned through the Bahamas on a path that could unleash more stormy weather and flooding along the Atlantic Coast.

The National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory that it had upgraded the storm to an ...extremely dangerous.. Category 4 hurricane. It has maximum sustained winds near 130 miles per hour, with strengthening possible in the next 24 hours.

It is expected during that period to turn toward the west and north on Thursday night, passing near or over portions of the northwestern Bahamas on Friday.

While forecasters say they have yet to pin down whether the storm will hit the Eastern Seaboard, many states are bracing for its fallout. Rain and winds have been buffeting much of the East Coast this week and they are likely to continue for the next few days, even if the center of Joaquin stays offshore, the center said. Two of the more reliable tracking models keep Joaquin offshore.

That uncertainty has prompted officials in states along the Atlantic to urge residents to take precautions. Several governors have declared a state of emergency for their state.

In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory has ordered state agencies to prepare for flooding in the state, which is already saturated by another storm system that unleashed several inches of rain. The emergency management agency said five to seven inches of rain could fall Thursday through Saturday, with more on Sunday as the hurricane nears. Some forecasts say that portions of the Carolinas could get up to 20 inches of rain.

In a news conference, Mr. McCrory said nearly the entire state was under flood watch even before Hurricane Joaquin. Equipment and boats were being prepared in case evacuations were needed. Crews from central Pennsylvania were on standby in case they needed to supplement any evacuation or clearing efforts on the coast.

...We hope that we have to respond to nothing,.. he said in a news conference.

Referring to the hurricane..È path, he said, ...The projections are all over the place at this point and time...

...In the next 10-24 hours we will get more direction,.. he said.

He said they were most concerned about the eastern parts of the state and the coastal Outer Banks, but the storm had the potential to affect the mountain areas, because of the potential of flooding streams.

In Virginia, Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, allowing state and local emergency responders to begin to prepare for the eight to 10 inches of rain forecast for Thursday and Friday, as well as for any effect on the state from Hurricane Joaquin, a statement said.

The governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, who is running for the Republican nomination for president, also declared a state of emergency and canceled campaign events for the weekend ahead to focus on the storm.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York activated the state emergency operations center in Albany in anticipation of heavy rain, high winds, coastal flooding and power failures as the hurricane makes its way up the coast, a statement said.

In South Carolina, the state..È emergency management division distributed the hurricane guide online including coastal evacuation maps, information about how to stay connected, and advice on storing bottled water and nonperishable food.

...There..È a lot of uncertainty in the forecasts from the National Hurricane Center,.. the division director, Kim Stenson, said in a statement. ...We are preparing for the possibility that this storm could affect South Carolina, we..Èe asking residents to do the same...

Officials in Pennsylvania urged residents to watch for flooding and strong winds. ...We are several days away from any impact from Hurricane Joaquin, but we..Èe expecting more rain this weekend so if you live in a flood-prone area, get ready,.. said Richard D. Flinn Jr., director of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency.

The Delaware Emergency Management Agency said it was monitoring the potential for coastal and inland flooding over the next several days as well as the track of the hurricane.

The National Hurricane Center said the forecasts were not definitive.

...Confidence in the details of the forecast after 72 hours remains low, as there have been some large changes in the model guidance overnight,.. the center said. ...The range of possible outcomes is still large, and the possibility of a hurricane landfall in the Carolinas still cannot be ruled out...

Wherever the hurricane landed, the center said, ...minor to moderate coastal flooding.. could be expected in the Mid-Atlantic States and Northeast throughout the weekend.

The Bahamas will bear the brunt of the storm until at least Friday, as the storm drifts southwest before turning north to pummel the country..È central islands. Storm surges of five to eight feet were expected, forecasters said, and rainfall could total as much as 20 inches.
In general, the hurricane will start to head north from the Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center said a path toward the northwest and north is expected on Friday, and a faster motion toward the north is expected Friday night and Saturday.

But some of the data models that forecasters use, gleaned from aerial surveillance missions, show several possibilities for where the hurricane goes next.

One shows the possibility of the hurricane taking a sharp westward turn over the Carolinas in three to four days. Another model suggests that the hurricane will track toward Long Island and southern New England in five days.

A further possibility is that Hurricane Joaquin will move further east into the ocean in four to five days.",,,,,,,,20.96,4.67,1.8,2.86,17.29,10.6,5.09,2.23,5.2,0.53,4.98,5.3,0,0,0,0,2.12,1,0

45,0,"SEATTLE ... Environmental goals about garbage in this and other like-minded cities increasingly come down to three words: Throw less away. So Seattle residents are given different bins to put out on the curb ... one for yard and food waste, another for recycling ... and are encouraged to use ever-tinier cans for the stuff that really is trash.

The rules were given teeth this year, when Seattle became one of the first cities in the nation to penalize residents for sorting poorly. If, on inspection, more than 10 percent of a garbage can..È contents should have properly been in another kind of bin, the trash collector can pin a bright red tag on the offender..È receptacle. Financial penalties have been authorized but not yet levied. A primary goal of the policy is to keep people from throwing food and recyclable materials into trash cans.

This week, a group of Seattle residents ... while stressing that they agreed with the city..È goals ... said the inspections violated their privacy, as protected by the Washington State Constitution. What people toss away, the group argued in a lawsuit filed on Thursday, is still theirs to protect, however much, especially in these warm days of summer and rot, they might want to get rid of it all as soon as possible.

...This case is not about composting ... this is about tossing our privacy rights in the garbage,.. said Sally Oljar, 60, a graphic designer and one of the plaintiffs. ...An admirable goal does not justify a bad policy,.. she added.

A lawyer for the city, John Schochet, declined to comment, saying his office was still studying the lawsuit.

Other cities, including San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia, have statutes requiring residents to keep food waste out of the garbage, though neither has a mechanism of enforcement like Seattle..È. And some cities, including La Crosse, Wis., have experimented with cameras that track what comes out of a bin when it is dumped.

What constitutes improper snooping in the trash is a question that courts have dug into before. The United States Supreme Court, in a case in 1988, said that the decision to throw something away effectively puts that object into the public domain. The police do not need a warrant, the court ruled, to grab a suspect..È garbage and take it down to the station for examination in a drug case.

But lawyers for the plaintiffs in Seattle said that Washington law has mostly gone the other way. The state Constitution, they said, has stringent and specific language about privacy. And the Washington Supreme Court held in a case in 1990 that law enforcement officials needed a warrant to search a suspect..È trash for evidence in a criminal case.

...A person has a legitimate expectation that the contents of his or her garbage cans will remain private,.. said the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in King County Superior Court. The eight plaintiffs are represented free of charge by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit, conservative group that advocates property rights and limited government.

But if residents and businesses can be driven to distraction by garbage sorting, Seattle-style, pity even more the poor garbage collector.

What, after all, is 10 percent? And how should it be calculated? A training manual for trash collection workers, posted by the plaintiffs in their lawsuit, suggests gauging the percentage by visually dividing a can into 10 segments. ...Use good judgment,.. the training guide says. Trash workers cannot tear into a bag to search, the manual says, but must judge only on what they can see, either through clear plastic or after the contents have been dumped into the truck.

Formal legal proof of a 10 percent violation, the lawsuit said, would require hard math: The radius squared and the height of the can would have to be multiplied by Pi (3.14, not Pie, as in a thrown-away dessert) and then divided by 10. And even before then, the plaintiffs and their lawyers said, the sorting of what goes where can be complicated.

...We commit to doing our part to achieve a low-carbon global economy in the long-term, including developing and deploying innovative technologies striving for a transformation of the energy sectors by 2050 and invite all countries to join us in this endeavour,.. the leaders said in their final communique.
...To this end we also commit to develop long-term, national low-carbon strategies...
Asked what this means for Canada..È energy sector, Harper said:
...Nobody..È going to start to shut down their industries or turn off the lights. We simply got to find a way to create lower-carbon emitting sources of energy...
Harper took part the G7 leaders..Èshortened talks on climate change as the summit entered its second and final day.
...All leaders understand that to achieve these kinds of milestones over the decades to come will require serious technological transformation,.. Harper said.
The Canadian Press has been told by sources who saw the working draft of the G7..È climate-change communique that Canada and Japan worked behind the scenes to water down the statement.
Merkel placed the fight against climate change at the heart of her sweeping agenda.
She wanted the G7 summit to give France momentum when it hosts the United Nations climate change conference this December, which aims to reach a breakthrough agreement in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Merkel had been pushing the G7 to endorse a pledge to reach zero carbon emissions, but Canada and Japan were holdouts.
...Canada and Japan are the most concerned about this one,.. said one source who was privy to discussions but would only speak on the condition of anonymity.
...The two of those countries have been the most difficult on every issue on climate. They don..È want any types of targets in there, so I think they are trying to make it as vague as possible at this point...
Harper and Merkel spoke together on Sunday, but the prime minister..È office said they did not discuss climate change.
...It..È shocking that Mr. Harper didn..È even bother to bring up climate change as an issue for discussion during his bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel,.. said New Democrat foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar.
He said Harper is out of touch and sidelining Canada internationally.
Harper..È office said in a statement that the French-led climate talks focused on the ...collective response to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the advancement of energy security in the face of escalating threats...
It said the G7 leaders chose to devote a portion of the climate session to a discussion of global security threats posed by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria and the ongoing fight against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. Harper..È only bilateral meeting on Monday was with newly elected Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.
A senior Canadian government official, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said Canada endorses a statement by the G7 that would support the December climate change talks in France.
...We support agreement in Paris that includes all GHG emitting countries,.. the official said, noting that in 2013 Canada..È emissions dropped 3.1 per cent from 2005 levels.
...We believe we have a fair and ambitious reduction target that is in line with other major industrialized economies. It reflects our national circumstance,.. the Canadian official said.
Other groups disagree.

49,0,"OTTAWA...Canada..È spies are warning the federal government about an ...extremist.. threat to natural resource development, internal documents show.
...Extremists.. have united both in person and online in their opposition to Canadian natural resource projects, according to a September 2014 ...threat overview.. prepared by CSIS for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney.
The heavily censored document does not outline specific threats or projects, nor does it single out particular groups. But it lists the threat between sections on terrorist travellers and a growing anti-Muslim movement advocating violence in Canada.
The CSIS report, obtained under Access to Information law, mirrors strong language in a January 2014 report from the RCMP warning of an ...anti-Canadian petroleum movement... The report, obtained by Greenpeace, said that movement is well financed and organized, and includes ...peaceful activists, militants, and violent extremists...
The RCMP specifically referred to 2013 shale gas protests in New Brunswick, where protesters from the Elsipogtog First Nation clashed with police.
Canada..È spies and police have monitored all manner of protests ... including environmental activism ... even if those demonstrations remained peaceful.
The Conservative government has defended the practice of monitoring that dissent, saying even peaceful protests can turn ugly and public safety must be maintained in the event of violence.
Activists have expressed concerns that expanded powers for CSIS, contained within the government..È anti-terror legislation, Bill C-51, will mean increased monitoring and ...disruption.. of environmental and First Nations protests.
Craig Forcese, who specializes in national security law and has been a vocal critic of Bill C-51, says violent protests may fall under CSIS..È purview. The question for Forcese, however, is how many people fall under CSIS..È definition of extremist.
...It..È not improper, it seems to me, to be concerned about someone who might be preparing a pipe bomb, or might be involved in the sabotage of a pipeline,.. Forcese said in an interview Thursday.
...The question is how broad the brush stroke is, and that..È really difficult to answer...
The Star requested an interview with Blaney..È office, and included specific questions about how the government defines ...extremist.. activity and what natural resource projects have been threatened by extremists.
...The safety and security of Canadians is of the utmost importance to our government, and we take any threat to the security of Canadians and their livelihood seriously,.. said Blaney..È spokesperson, Jeremy Laurin, in a written statement.
...Our police officers have a mandate and responsibility to investigate threats as they arise.
...Our government respects and protects the right of Canadians to participate in lawful protest activities.""
NDP environment critic Megan Leslie said there are valid reasons to monitor people suspected of plotting attacks or violence. But Leslie worries that the ...extremist.. label could be applied too broadly.
...Because of the way (the government is) so carelessly using language, or purposefully using language to be very broad and apply to everyone, that..È where the danger lays,.. Leslie said Wednesday.
...Either they..Èe tossing around words like ...extremist..Èwilly-nilly, which is pretty terrible, or they..Èe doing it intentionally, which is just as terrible.

50,0,"WASHINGTON...Shrinking glaciers, Arctic temperatures and a mix of messy energy politics await President Barack Obama on his trip to Alaska, where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to set foot north of the Arctic Circle.
Obama departs Monday for a three-day tour of the largest U.S. state, aiming to call attention to the ways Obama says climate change is already damaging Alaska..È stunning scenery. By showcasing thawing permafrost, melting sea ice and eroding shorelines, Obama hopes to raise a sense of urgency to slow climate change in the U.S. and overseas.
Even before he departed, Obama was making waves with a decision to rename Alaska..È famed Mount McKinley despite a backlash.
The gesture was a major show of solidarity with the Alaska Arctic..È native people, who have received less attention amid Obama..È recent efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans in the mainland U.S.
Obama announced that his administration is changing the name of North America..È tallest peak, the 6,193-metre Mount McKinley, to Denali, its traditional Athabascan name.
Obama..È move to strip the mountain of its name honouring former President William McKinley, who was assassinated, drew loud condemnations from lawmakers in his native state of Ohio.

Yet Obama was to navigate far more turbulent political waters in Anchorage, where his grand declarations on climate change have been met with skepticism by leaders in a state that..È heavily dependent on oil revenues, which have fallen precipitously.
At the same time, environmental groups warned that Obama hadn..È done enough to protect Alaska and the climate. They took particular offence at his administration..È move just a few weeks ago to give Royal Dutch Shell a final permit for expanded drilling off Alaska..È northwest coast.
...I share people..È concerns about offshore drilling. I remember the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico all too well,.. Obama said in his weekly address. Yet he said the U.S. economy still had to rely on oil and gas while it transitions to cleaner renewable fuels, and said his administration was ensuring those risks were minimized.
Obama was to hold a listening session with Alaska Natives before speaking at a climate-focused Arctic summit, which involves leaders from Arctic and non-Arctic nations.
Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are intensely focused on a global climate treaty that nations hope to finalize in December, as the president works to secure his environmental legacy before leaving office.
Obama has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 per cent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and planned to use the Alaska visit to press other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.
Kerry told reporters in Alaska on Sunday that climate change skeptics won..È be remembered kindly.
...I think the people who are slow to come to this table will be written up by historians as having been some of the folks most irresponsible in understanding and reacting to scientific analysis,.. Kerry said.
Obama will also go on a boat tour Tuesday of Kenai Fjords National Park and to hike to Exit Glacier, a sprawling expanse of ice that is retreating, in what environmentalists say is a dramatic sign of warming temperatures.
In Dillingham, in southwest Alaska, Obama will meet Wednesday with fishermen locked in an conflict with miners over plans to build a massive gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, home to the world..È largest salmon fishery.

51,0,"At a time when many Republicans are racing to distance themselves from Donald J. Trump, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is forging an unusual path: He..È taking pains to emphasize that, although he found Mr. Trump..È comments on illegal immigrants ...inappropriate,.. the real estate baron is a ...friend,.. the two are ...close.. and Mr. Trump is ...a good guy...

The tactic ... a hate-the-sin, love-the-sinner approach to politics ... is striking because Mr. Christie has long prided himself on the depth of his support from Latinos, who reacted with anger and dismay to Mr. Trump..È assertion that Mexicans sneaking across the border are rapists and criminals.

To be sure, Mr. Christie denounced Mr. Trump..È caustic words on immigrants on Mr. Christie..È second day as an official candidate for president, saying at a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., that ...the comments were inappropriate and have no place in this race...

But as for the man himself? Here..È a few of the nicer things Mr. Christie has had to say about Mr. Trump:

On July 1: Mr. Christie told Sean Hannity of Fox News that the first thing that came to mind when he heard Mr. Trump..È name was ...a friend...

On July 3: ...I like Donald. He..È a good guy...

On July 6: ...He tries to provoke reaction, that..È part of who Donald is... Mr. Christie also added that Mr. Trump is a ...good friend...

And Monday morning, on ...Fox and Friends,.. Mr. Christie said he had had enough with the Trump questions. ...Donald is a friend, I..Èe known him for 13 years, and I like him personally...

He added: ...But his comments were inappropriate. That..È now the 50th time I..Èe said it. It..È going to be the last time I say it...

The two have indeed been friends for a while. But Mr. Christie..È frequent pledges of friendship could be a curious and potentially treacherous path.

The governor has made outreach to the Latino community a centerpiece of both his record and his campaign: He won over 50 percent of the Latino vote in his re-election, a fact he regularly points out on the campaign trail, and he took a three-day trip to Mexico in September.

And the proposals that he has outlined on immigration and boarder security ... that a fence along the southern border is ineffective and sends the wrong message ... run in direct contrast to Mr. Trump..È promise to build as grand and imposing a border fence as humanly possible.

But perhaps those disagreements are best worked out among friends.",,,,,,,,20.38,10.51,6.07,4.44,13.32,14.02,6.54,2.1,2.8,2.1,8.88,3.97,1.64,0,0.23,0,5.61,0,0

Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a possible candidate for president in 2016, told a private gathering of New Hampshire Republicans this month that he supported a pathway to legal status ... but not citizenship ... for undocumented immigrants in the United States, according to the chairwoman of the state..È Republican Party.

The chairwoman, Jennifer Horn, described Mr. Walker..È statements on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported that Mr. Walker had endorsed eventual citizenship for those immigrants, which many Republicans oppose.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Walker, Kirsten Kukowski, disputed those reports about Mr. Walker embracing a pathway to citizenship.

...Governor Walker has been very clear that he does not support amnesty and believes that border security must be established and the rule of law must be followed,.. she said in a statement. ...He does not support citizenship for illegal immigrants... She did not respond to requests to provide any audio recording of Mr. Walker..È remarks at the Copper Door.

Mr. Walker tends to avoid phrases like ...legal status.. and ...citizenship.. in public, but has said emphatically that he opposes any amnesty for undocumented immigrants. Mr. Walker did once support a pathway to citizenship, but said he changed his mind after talking to governors of border states, among others. Any perceived reversal on the immigration issue would complicate Mr. Walker..È efforts to appeal to many conservative Republican primary voters and leave him open to criticism for changing positions.

Mr. Walker..È remarks came during a gathering with Republican activists after a dinner at the Copper Door restaurant in Bedford, N.H., where he ate with Ms. Horn and a few other guests.

After the dinner, a few Republican activists joined Mr. Walker for coffee and cake, and to ask him questions. One of the questions, according to Ms. Horn, was about Mr. Walker..È position on immigration.

Mr. Walker spoke for roughly three minutes about a process in which undocumented immigrants would be required to start the process anew and pay back taxes.

But Mr. Walker..È answer was apparently vague enough to prompt Ms. Horn to follow-up.

...To clarify, what you are saying is that you are advocating that the people who are already here, the 11-12 million people who are here illegally in our country, should have a path to legal status, not citizenship?.. she asked.

...Yes,.. Mr. Walker responded, according to Ms. Horn.

Another New Hampshire Republican who was there, Mark Vincent, chairman of the Hillsborough County Republican Committee, said he did not remember Mr. Walker ever using the word ...citizenship.. in his remarks.

54,0,"Until my 8-year-old granddaughter, Emilia, and I pretended to be tourists in New York, it had honestly never occurred to me that Times Square might be the nicest neighborhood in the city. At the places where out-of-towners go, I was struck by how many young employees of these attractions asked us if we were enjoying ourselves, if we were having fun. More surprisingly, they seemed genuinely interested in our replies. They appeared to have been hired for their humorous, friendly dispositions.

I..Èe lived in New York almost all my life, but not once have so many strangers inquired after my welfare and happiness as they did during the snowy February weekend and the subsequent Sunday in early March during which Emilia and I played tourist.

The project was Emilia..È idea. She..È at an age at which she has a spongelike relationship with information, and some of that new information concerns the city where she has lived all her life. She..È been saying she wanted to go to Times Square, where in fact she..È been ... we..È seen ...Matilda.. and ...The Lion King.. on Broadway ... but she didn..È know that. Maybe she was confused because Times Square was never presented to her as a destination, but rather as an obstacle course to be traversed between the subway and the theater.

She also asked to go to the top of the Empire State Building, where I had never been, and to visit the Statue of Liberty, where I hadn..È been since a day-camp field trip, during the summer after fifth grade. And though she..È been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we agreed we..È go there so she could help her grandmother tell other children (and their families) what they might like to see.

In fact, by the time we finished our pretend tour of New York, I wanted to urge all my out-of-town friends with children and grandchildren: Come visit! Bring the family! Whatever you..Èe heard about the city being crowded or dirty or unfriendly isn..È true. It..È a playground for young and old!

Emilia and I started at the Empire State Building. The observatory entrance, on Fifth Avenue just south of 34th Street, is decorated with traces of Art Deco, a foretaste of the gleaming Art Deco sculptures and paneling employed throughout the building..È magnificent lobby. I..È been warned by friends to go early in the day. I..È also been advised to purchase tickets to the observatories (on the 86th and 102nd floor) online, in advance, so as to avoid the long lines and lengthy waits for the elevators.

At 10 in the morning in the dead of winter, the lines weren..È especially long, and we could probably have done without the (expensive) advance tickets, but the pile-up at the security checkpoint and the roped-off mazes prepared to keep crowds inching along made us realize that on another day, at another time, our experience could have been very different. The elevator rides were fast and fun, and I loved the view from the open observatory on the 86th floor and the smaller, enclosed one, higher up.

It was especially pleasant to take in the amazing 360-degree panorama without the crowds, which, I imagine, could make the observation deck feel like a rush-hour subway, 86 stories high. Emilia found the experience exciting, but less fun. She..È not an anxious or fearful child, but she is an honest one. She admitted that the view ... we could see all the way into Brooklyn and pick out the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, near where she lives ... was awesome. But there was something slightly sickening about looking down from that height. Once around each of the observatories and she was ready to go back down, though she smiled politely at the elevator operators and guards who asked if we had had a good time.

Another thing we did in advance, and which I tell everyone with children living in New York or planning a trip here to do ahead, is buy tickets for a play at the New Victory Theater. On 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the New Victory is a vintage theater refurbished just enough to retain plenty of funky charm. It specializes in children..È programming, featuring theater groups from all over the world. The shows we..Èe liked best in the past have been the most circuslike.

This time we watched a performance titled ...Cambuyon,.. featuring a troupe (from Barcelona and the Canary Islands) of tap and hip-hop dancers, vocalists and percussionists, a riveting succession of numbers including a singer who could imitate all the instruments in a band and a pair or dancers ... sisters, or Emilia thought, maybe twins ... who could give the impression of dislocating and reattaching every joint in their bodies. The theater is staffed by city teenagers who couldn..È be nicer; tickets are reasonably priced, refreshments cheap, and no one hawks costly corporate souvenirs during intermission.

If we hadn..È had theater tickets for noon, we could have spent much longer at Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, which was not only far more enjoyable than I..È imagined but potentially educational: I would have liked to have had the time and leisure to tell Emilia more about some of the figures we encountered: Nelson Mandela, Fidel Castro and the Dalai Lama, among many others. But perhaps it was better that I simply followed her around as she ran to see the exhibits that most interested her: Taylor Swift, Abraham Lincoln and Amelia Earhart, whom she had learned all about in school.

After she overcame the initial creepiness (her word) of seeing people made of wax, she was in a state of pure delight. She asked to have her picture taken with ...Judy Garland.. as Dorothy in ...The Wizard of Oz,.. and would have climbed onto E.T...È bicycle if there hadn..È been a line.

Flatteringly, she..È asked if there would be a statue of me. I said I imagined very few writers would be there, but in fact we saw likenesses of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Maya Angelou. It was interesting to see whom she recognized (Albert Einstein, Jimi Hendrix) and whom she didn..È (the Spice Girls and the Jonas Brothers are ancient history for an 8-year-old).

But it was no surprise that her absolute favorite moment of our entire pretend-tourist excursion was the chance to have her picture taken with statues of the Beatles. She..È going through an intense Beatlemania phase, and it thrilled her to sit at the feet of her idols. In the elevator going down, a young museum employee asked what Emilia had liked best, and they had a lively conversation about the Beatles.

As a responsible grandparent, I can usually hold out against requests for revolting quantities of sugar, but I..È be lying if I said we didn..È enjoy the Times Square M & M..È store, at Broadway and 49th Street, on the northern fringes of Times Square. The columns of colored candies (25,000 square feet of candy!) with levers that release precise helpings of sweetness into plastic bags had an amusing Willy Wonka fantasy element, and we promised each other (and, in absentia, Emilia..È mom and dad) that we would never again consume three-quarters of a pound of candy over a single weekend.

Saving the sweets for dessert, we walked around the neighborhood until we found a place where we felt like having lunch. Emilia..È out-of-towner facade cracked to reveal the cosmopolitan Brooklynite when she asked if we could eat at the Thai restaurant, Pongsri, on 48th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, where she ordered (and ate all of) a delicious pad thai.

As we traveled uptown to meet her grandpa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Emilia, who..È been there often, said that she would be our guide to what she considered the most child-friendly exhibits.

I was glad to see that the Egyptian tombs and the hall of the medieval knights in armor were as thrilling to her as they..È been to me, when I was her age. She..È especially fond of the galleries off the equestrian armor hall, which feature the imposing and terrifying masks, helmets and body armor favored by Japanese samurais.

Other big hits were the Temple of Dendur, where the large open areas, the windows looking out onto Central Park and the reflecting pool provide a welcome break from the more confining spaces of the traditional galleries.

Emilia, who is half Mexican, feels a kind of national pride in the collection of brilliantly decorative gold jewelry made by the ancient civilizations that inhabited Central America. And the Michael C. Rockefeller wing ... with gigantic figures, as large as small buildings and fashioned by the Asmat, an ethnic group in New Guinea ... is a perennial favorite.

As a general rule for museum-going with children, I prefer to see a couple of exhibits and then get out before exhaustion and boredom set in. But during this somewhat longer visit, Emilia handled the problem of visual-art overload (which even adults experience) by taking pictures with my phone (permitted, as long as there is no flash) of everything that caught her eye. At first I mistook this for a way of not really looking, but after a while I realized that it was her way of looking without having to worry about remembering what she..È seen.

The public cafeteria in the basement of the museum was a major success, with excellent food and a wide array of choices. Apparently having learned from the fast-food industry..È creative approach to packaging, the museum allows kids to choose their food and arrange it in cardboard containers designed to look like yellow New York taxi cabs.

Emilia was excited about our trip to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. She prepared by reading a children..È book, ...You Wouldn..È Want to Be a Worker on the Statue of Liberty,.. part of a witty and informative series, each emphasizing the hardship of building various world monuments (the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids). She had learned many interesting facts: Did I know that the statue used to be the color of a new penny?
Even on a cold and windy Sunday morning in March, the ferries to Lady Liberty and from there to Ellis Island and home were mobbed with tourists, the majority of whom seemed to have come from Europe and Asia. The ferry rides were brief and pleasant, in fact so brief I spent a good part of the trip from Battery Park to Liberty Island waiting in line for a soda at the snack bar.

To reach the statue..È pedestal required us to pass through tight security twice, once before boarding the boat and once at the entrance to the statue. And by the time we finished waiting on windy docks, shuffling slowly forward in crowds and being instructed to remove our watches and sweaters, I felt I was not only visiting the scene of my great-grandparents..Èarrival at Ellis Island, but partly reliving it, minus the anti-lice fumigation and the mandatory dental exam.

In advance of our trip to the statue, we bought ...platform access.. tickets, which required a somewhat arduous climb up flights of stairs (the elevator seemed not to be working) at the end of which we were able to step out on a rather narrow platform from which we could see more of the New York skyline and the harbor, and less of the statue than we had from the ground. Happily, tickets to Lady Liberty..È crown, which involves a very long climb, were not available until the beginning of June.

Tickets to the Statue of Liberty allow passengers to take three ferry trips: from downtown Manhattan to Liberty Island, from there to Ellis Island, and back to Manhattan, though it..È possible to skip the Ellis Island portion and remain on the boat. On the day of our excursion, the ferry rides and the waits in line to board the boats were approximately the same length.

The Ellis Island Museum is housed in a historic and fascinatingly evocative structure; the restoration has preserved many of the original tiles and architectural details. And in the enormous, high-ceilinged registry room, we got the sense of what it might have been like to wait for one..È name to be called by immigration officials. But the museum exhibits (mostly large placards and captions) seemed old-fashioned and a little tired, and while a tech-savvy 8-year-old was able to figure out how the guided audio tour worked, her grandmother was not.

Our experience as pretend tourists occupied the better part of two days. We could have done it in a weekend if bad weather hadn..È forced us to wait two weeks between our trips to Times Square and the Statue of Liberty. The best part of the second day, we both agreed, was the ferry ride to Liberty Island.

As the statue comes slowly into view it..È impossible not to be struck by how beautiful, how powerfully meaningful, it is; and I found it moving to approach Ellis Island by boat and to know that my ancestors had made a similar journey during the first decade of the 20th century.

By the end of the day (a day during which I decided that if I were ever to do it again, let..È say when my 6-month-old grandson wants to play tourist, I..È go early on a weekday morning) I felt much as I imagine my great-grandmother must have felt at the end of her voyage: grateful and relieved. And it crossed my mind that no one had asked us if we were having a good time ... even though we..È had such a good time pretending to be tourists in the exciting and surprisingly friendly city in which we live.",,,,,,,,29.11,10.69,7.13,3.56,15.8,14,6.91,3.61,5.37,0.6,3.31,5.41,0.3,0.13,0.04,0.17,0.6,0,0

55,0,"WARSAW ... Even though the former Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been asked to accept just a tiny fraction of the refugees that Germany and other nations are taking, their fierce resistance now stands as the main impediment to a unified European response to the crisis.

Poland..È new president, Andrzej Duda, has complained about ...dictates.. from the European Union to accept migrants flowing onto the Continent from the Middle East and Africa.

Slovakia..È prime minister, Robert Fico, says his country will accept only Christian refugees as it would be ...false solidarity.. to force Muslims to settle in a country without a single mosque. Viktor Orban, Hungary..È hard-line prime minister, calls the influx a ...rebellion by illegal migrants.. and pledges a new crackdown this week.

The discord has further unsettled a union already shaky from struggles over the euro and the Greek financial crisis and now facing a historic influx of people attracted by Europe..È relative peace and prosperity.

When representatives of the European Union nations meet on Monday to take up a proposal for allocating refugees among them, Central and Eastern European nations are likely to be the most vocal opponents. Their stance ... reflecting a mix of powerful far-right movements, nationalism, racial and religious prejudices as well as economic arguments that they are less able to afford to take in outsiders than their wealthier neighbors ... is the latest evidence of the stubborn cultural and political divides that persist between East and West.

When joining the European Union ... as the former Communist countries have done since 2004 ... nations are asked to pledge support to a raft of so-called European values, including open markets, transparent government, respect for an independent media, open borders, cultural diversity, protection of minorities and a rejection of xenophobia.

But the reality is that the former Communist states have proved sluggish in actually absorbing many of these values and practicing them. Oligarchs, cronyism and endemic corruption remain a part of daily life in many of the countries, freedom of the press is in decline while rising nationalism and populist political movements have stirred anti-immigrant tensions.

...People must remember that Poland has been transitioning from communism for only 25 years,.. Lech Walesa, who led that country..È independence movement, said in an interview. ...Our salaries and houses are still smaller than those in the West. Many people here don..È believe that they have anything to share with migrants. Especially that they see that migrants are often well-dressed, sometimes better than many Poles...

Few migrants, in fact, are particularly interested in settling in Eastern Europe, preferring to head to Germany or Scandinavia, where social welfare benefits are higher, employment opportunities greater and immigrant communities better established. In that sense, migrants are aligned with leaders in Eastern and Central European capitals, who frequently argue that the 28-member bloc should focus first on securing its borders and figuring out a way to end the war in Syria before talking about mandatory quotas for accepting refugees.

But as often as not, the political discourse in these countries has quickly moved toward a wariness of accepting racial and religious diversity.

...This refugee flow has outraged the right wing,.. said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. ...If you scratch the surface, why are they so upset? It..È not about jobs or the ability to manage them or social welfare. What it is really about is that they are Muslim...

Unlike countries in Western Europe, which have long histories of accepting immigrants from diverse cultures, the former Communist states tend to be highly homogeneous. Poland, for instance, is 98 percent white and 94 percent Catholic.

...And the countries that have very little diversity are some of the most virulently against refugees,.. said Andrew Stroehlein, European media director for Human Rights Watch.

Even mainstream political leaders eager for closer ties to Brussels, the European Union..È headquarters, feel pressure to appeal to this growing nationalist wave.

...By toughening up their rhetoric and showing a strong hand toward the Roma minority, facing down the E.U. and refusing a common solution to the refugee crisis, they are trying to outbid the far right and keep the traditional political parties in power,.. said Zuzana Kus., a senior research fellow at the Institute for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences.

There is also widespread disappointment with the pace of economic change since communism..È fall, and a sense that the countries are too poor to offer substantial support to immigrants.

...There is a long history of victimization in our region,.. said Csaba Szal._, a professor of sociology at Masaryk University in Brno. ...We are the ones who have always been victims of injustice, the ones who have suffered. And now there is somebody trying to grab that status. People find it very difficult to accept that somebody might suffer more than us...

While rising xenophobia is playing a role, there are other factors behind the East-West divide, said Marcin Zaborowski, executive vice president at the Center for European Policy Analysis and head of its Warsaw office.

...The primary reason for this difference in attitude is that we come from a region where the tradition of accepting culturally different refugees is very weak,.. he said. ...And now there is this wave of refugees from another continent that has no precedent, so people don..È know what to think...

Most of the countries, like Poland, have ...no proper infrastructure in place to deal with such cultural assimilation.. and little appetite to spend precious resources building one, Mr. Zaborowski said.

As for the region..È seeming indifference to the migrants..Èplight, that is partly because unlike France, Britain and Germany, the former Communist states have no history of colonialism, he said.

...The attitude is: We didn..È meddle in these countries that are now sending the refugees, like other nations did, and so we have no sense of guilt about our obligation to deal with them,.. Mr. Zaborowski said.

And all of these attitudes blend together into a common aversion to being told what to do by Brussels.

In Hungary, Mr. Orban has taken a particularly uncompromising approach, demanding more help from Brussels in dealing with the tens of thousands who continue to enter his country while insisting that Hungary is under no obligation to endanger its traditional Christian values by accepting large numbers of Muslims.

On Tuesday, a new raft of refugee laws go into effect that will allow the Hungarian government to build new ...transit zones.. at the border where arrivals would have their asylum requests quickly reviewed ... eight days, plus three more for an appeal, a pace that refugee advocates believe violates European Union due process rules.

But Hungary is not the only country that has taken a hard line or seen anti-immigrant protests.

Anti-immigrant marches have become a regular occurrence in Slovakia and some other nations.

In Estonia, the northernmost Baltic nation, which has a population of just 1.3 million, an agreement to accept fewer than 200 refugees over the next two years was enough to set off protests. Right-wing bikers demonstrated outside the country..È only refugee relocation facility in July, and earlier this month it was severely damaged in a fire.

Officials in Latvia said they would continue to resist mandatory requirements that they accept a set number of refugees while the parties in the ruling coalition appear unable to agree on whether to require a parliamentary vote on the issue.

...It would be very wrong and sad if this matter threatened the government,.. said President Raimonds Vejonis.

Lithuanian officials said they were open to discussing the acceptance of more refugees, but only on a voluntary basis, and would continue to oppose a ...permanent mechanism.. that would allocate future refugees.

Bulgaria had agreed to accept 500 refugees, but under a new formula unveiled last week, it could be asked to take up to 2,000.

Talking by phone while driving from an economic conference in southern Poland, Robert Biedron, the mayor of the city of Slupsk, said he was ashamed of the reaction of many to the plight of the migrants. ...There is always conflict around the world and people need help,.. Mr. Biedron said. ...Perhaps, someday again, the Polish people might need help. Do we want to hear, ...Oh, Poles are a danger to society, you are different, you are not of our culture...È..

Already, he said, he has blocked many former friends on Facebook ... ...even well-educated people, who I thought were my friends.. ... over anti-immigrant comments they have posted.

...Here I am, driving on a road that was built with European Union money,.. Mr. Biedron said. ...It was built with money taken from taxpayers in Italy and Germany and France. Now we refuse to do our part? I am really ashamed...

Mr. Walesa said he intended to do his part. Reacting to a call from Pope Francis that Catholics take in a refugee family, Mr. Walesa said he wanted to do just that, if he can talk his wife into it.

56,0,"FORT MCMURRAY, ALTA....Work in the oilsands never stops: 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Christmas, New Year..È and long weekends.
Little surprise that the residents of Fort McMurray work the longest hours in Canada and earn the highest average annual household income: $191,507.
Because it..È a 24-7 economy, it..È not unusual to see pickup trucks lined up at the Tim Hortons drive-thru at 5 in the morning and continuing for the rest of the day. Earlier this year, the long lines were creating traffic hazards so the RCMP handed out $172 tickets to vehicles blocking adjacent roads.
Those Tim Hortons, McDonald..È, Burger King, Wendy..È and A&W outlets are an essential part of life in hectic ...Fort Mac.. and, for the most part, they depend on temporary foreign workers, who earn between $15 and $18 an hour.
May, 36, who has been in Canada for three years, says she was recruited from the Philippines to work at a fast food counter.
...But I didn..È like it, so I switched and became a nanny...
With the long work hours, and the number of households where both parents work in the oilpatch, there is a high demand for domestic help.
Earlier this year, Sara Dorow, a sociologist at the University of Alberta, completed a study of nannies working in Fort McMurray.
She estimates there are 600 to 1,000 nannies. Parents with two preschool-aged children save an average of $6,970 a year by hiring one. And the savings are greater with more children. Licensed daycare, if you can find it, costs between $1,300 and $2,000 a month for each space, she told the Edmonton Journal.
Wages for a nanny can run anywhere between $12 and $20 an hour.
Eighty per cent of families with nannies have at least one spouse working at an oilsands plant. ...In other words, the oilsands industry is dependent on the sort of flexibility and consistency provided to its workers by live-in caregivers,.. says Dorow.
Temporary foreign workers can also be found at Canadian Tire and Sobeys. Some, such as Luis, 49, drive trucks loaded with water to surrounding work camps. Others help to build the work camps or are employed as cleaners and housekeeping staff in the camps.

The Athabasca river flows past the growing suburbs of Fort McMurray, Alta. Temporary foreign workers have helped propel the city's booming economy, but recent rule changes have made it harder for them to stay on a long-term basis.

Most of the temporary foreign workers in Fort McMurray are from the Philippines, often sending money to their children and families back home.
Jonathan, 34, came to Canada five years ago and became a Canadian citizen in July. The truck driver says he sends 40 per cent of his earnings to the Philippines because his brother needs kidney dialysis.
He and 10 guest workers live in a small bungalow near the city centre. They pay rent totalling $5,800 a month.
Alma was a cleaner in Fort Mac. Even though she had worked in Canada for four years, she was sent back to the Philippines earlier this year after the federal government revised guest worker rules.
Before she left, she and some co-workers filed a complaint with their employer about overtime that was owed. The co-workers were subsequently fired.
Last year, the federal government announced changes to make it more difficult for temporary foreign workers to stay here on a long-term basis. Fort McMurray employers were outraged.
Wayne Bigelow, vice-president of operations for the three Tim Hortons franchises, told Fort McMurray Today that franchises might have to reduce hours and even close on certain days of the week.
...I think it will be mayhem in Fort McMurray if the temporary foreign workers have to leave,.. says Jennifer Best, executive director of YMCA community programs.
Best estimates there are 3,500 guest workers in Fort McMurray alone staffing fast food chains, hotels and work camps.
Not everyone is happy about the presence of so many temporary workers. Earlier this year, the Fort McMurray Airport Authority announced it was planning to lay off permanent, unionized cleaning and security staff in favour of hiring guest workers at lower pay.
A telephone poll conducted by Environics on behalf of the Alberta Federation of Labour found 89 per cent of respondents were opposed to the plan. Fifty-four per cent thought the airport CEO should be fired.
In the end, the workers were laid off and offered their jobs back at a lower rate. And the new contractor was encouraged to hire Canadians first.

57,0,"The federal government says it now has the power to revoke the citizenship of some Canadians convicted of terrorism, treason or espionage.
A controversial new law, first introduced last June, went into effect on Friday.
The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration says there are several serious crimes that could result in dual citizens losing their Canadian status.
The ministry says it would revoke citizenship for anyone found guilty of terrorism, treason and high treason, and spying for a foreign government.
The rules would also apply to dual citizens who take up arms against Canada by fighting in a foreign army or joining an international terrorist organization.
The new law has met with strong public criticism, and two Ontario lawyers have already launched a court case arguing it is unconstitutional.
Immigration Minister Chris Alexander argued the new rules are meant to confront what he described as the ...ever-evolving threat of jihadi terrorism...
...Our government knows that there is no higher purpose for any government than to ensure the safety and security of its citizens and we have never been afraid to call jihadi terrorism exactly what it is,.. Alexander said Friday in Toronto.
He said the changes to the Citizenship Act will ensure that ...those who wish to do us harm will not be able to exploit their Canadian citizenship to endanger Canadians or our free and democratic way of life...
Critics have expressed concerns about the way in which the new law could be applied to certain high-profile cases.
When they were first announced, the New Democrats extracted a promise from the government that the new rules would not be used to target Egyptian-Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy, who was then a dual citizen.
Fahmy was convicted of supporting a terrorist group in a widely-denounced trial held in Egypt and was originally sentenced to seven years.
The Al Jazeera television producer later gave up his Egyptian citizenship in an unsuccessful bid to be deported back to Canada and is currently undergoing a new trial on terrorism charges.
In a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair argued that Fahmy..È case highlighted the risks inherent in the new legislation.
In October, Toronto-based lawyers Paul Slansky and Rocco Galati launched a constitutional court challenge against the new law. Federal Court Judge Donald Rennie dismissed the case earlier this year.",,,,,,,,24.62,7.36,2.54,4.82,12.44,11.93,4.31,2.79,5.33,5.33,4.06,2.79,0,0,0,0,1.52,1,0

58,0,"OTTAWA...Conservative Leader Stephen Harper says his government ordered an audit of Syrian refugees admitted to Canada to ensure security concerns were being addressed but has denied a report that his political staff were involved in vetting and approving applications.
The plight of Syrian refugees ... and Canada..È response to the crisis ... blew up on the campaign trail Thursday with a report that Conservatives delayed the intake of vulnerable refugees from war-torn Syria in the spring as the prime minister..È office got directly involved in processing immigration files.
The Globe and Mail reported that the Prime Minister..È Office intervened in the processing of Syrian refugees and declared that all applicants referred by the United Nations would require Harper..È approval.
Such files are normally handled by Citizenship and Immigration officials.
CTV News, quoting Citizenship and Immigration insiders, reported Thursday night that the PMO went through Syrian refugee applications to ensure that religious minorities such as Christians were being accepted over applications from Shia and Sunni Muslims.
The Conservatives told CTV that potential security threats prompted the delay of applications. But Citizenship and Immigration sources told the network that politics were also an influencing factor.

CTV reported that PMO staff reviewed the files to ensure the right refugees were accepted, such as those with established communities in Canada, which Conservatives could hopefully attract into their fold.
Earlier Thursday, Harper strenuously denied the suggestion that his staff were involved, saying they had no role in approving applications.
...Political staff are never involved in approving refugee applications. Such decisions are made by officials in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration,.. Harper said at the start of a speech to a Vancouver-area audience.
The Globe and Mail also reported that the intake of Syrian refugees was paused as the government did an audit of the initial batch of 1,300 refugees accepted into the country.
Only UN-referred refugee files were audited as the government knows less about those cases when they arrive for processing than they do about refugees being brought to Canada by private groups, said a government source speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the system, Canadian Press reported.
Harper confirmed his office asked for an audit to confirm the government..È goals were being met.
...Our government has adopted a generous approach to the admission of refugees while ensuring the selection of the most vulnerable people and keeping our country safe and secure,.. Harper said.
Harper said his office asked for an audit to ensure ...these policy objectives are being met.
An official told the Star Thursday that the audit was sparked in part by open reports and intelligence reports raised concerns that Islamic State fighters were ...actively.. trying to infiltrate the flood of migrants and make their way to western countries.
...That is a very real concern,.. said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The audit meant a pause of the intake of government-sponsored refugees for several weeks, but private sponsorships continued uninterrupted, the official said.
He said the audit was a ...look at the process, not the worthiness of any particular file...
Still, Harper..È political rivals were quick to jump on reports of his alleged involvement, warning that it may have delayed help to desperate refugees.
...Now, we learn it was Stephen Harper, himself, who prevented the arrival of Syrian families into Canada in the worst Syrian refugee crisis since World War II,.. NDP Leader Thomas Mulcair said during a morning campaign stop in Toronto.
Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said the news report was further proof of Harper..È meddling instincts and said it was another reason to toss the Conservatives out of government in the coming election.
Loly Rico, president of the Canadian Council of Refugees, said the latest news could explain why Canada has been slow to accept refugees fleeing the civil war-torn country.
...Now, it..È understandable how low numbers on the resettlement will come in this year, because they delayed the process of selection, and also they..Èe selecting what type of refugees they (want),.. Rico told the Star.
Lorne Waldman of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers said the PMO..È alleged intervention strongly suggested that it was the Conservative government..È plan to only take in Christian minorities from war-torn Syria.
...Canada..È response to the crisis had been pathetic because we..È been preventing people from coming,.. Waldman said.
According to Waldman, all refugee applicants have to undergo security checks and some are then referred to an ...enhanced security check,.. if they fall under certain profiles, based on age or personal history.
Hanna Al-Khoulani of Mississauga have been waiting for 18 months on her refugee sponsorship for her nephew now stranded in Ivory Coast; she said she was surprised to learn Ottawa had put a hold on the government-assisted refugee program amid the PMO audit.
...The government has to do what it has to do, but they should have informed the public about it instead of keeping it a secret. That said, they should have continued the processing while they were doing the audit,.. she said. ...Any delay is unacceptable because so many people..È lives are in their hands...
Ratna Omidvar, of Lifeline Syria and Global Diversity Exchange, said that political interference on individual files would be ...highly unusual.. especially since the United Nations refugee agency has already vetted the cases.
She said the cases referred to Canada for settlement are usually ...highly vulnerable...
...So a family in some gravity of danger is being left in limbo when it should be in safety,.. Omidvar said. ...The real issue is how fast we can bring refugees in fear of their lives to safety...
Brian Dyck, chair of the Council of The Canadian Refugee Sponsorship Agreement Holders Association, said his group had been asking immigration officials since last year why there were so few profiles of Syrians in the selected pool for resettlement.
...We had no idea they had stopped processing UNHCR referred cases. There was no hint of a concern about security in our conversations,.. Dyck told the Star.
Immigration Minister Chris Alexander said that the intake of refugees was paused so the government could ensure that ...appropriate referral and screening procedures.. were in place.
...Starting a new refugee resettlement program in a volatile conflict zone poses particular challenges,.. Alexander said in a statement provided to the Star.

Disgraced former Conservative politician Dean Del Mastro finds out Thursday in a Peterborough, Ont., court if he will have to go to jail. Del Mastro is shown talking to media as he leaves court for lunch break at a sentencing hearing in Peterborough In January.

...Custody is required to reflect the need for denunciation and deterrence...
Cameron refused a defence request to allow him to serve his jail time intermittently.
In addition to two one-month jail terms he will have to serve concurrently for the overspending, Cameron also imposed four months of house arrest, to start after he is released, for the false return he filed.
He will also have to pay $10,000 to the Peterborough Electoral District Association, and will be on probation for 18 months.
Del Mastro, 44, has already filed an appeal of the conviction and was to apply for bail at a hearing Friday. He was led away after the sentencing in handcuffs and shackles before being taken to a jail in nearby Lindsay. His wife was in tears.

Accountant Richard McCarthy, 68, who was Del Mastro..È agent, was given a two-month conditional sentence plus one year of probation for his role. Cameron said McCarthy had acquiesced to the machinations ... or at least was ...wilfully blind.. to them ... but was much less culpable.
Once Harper..È point man defending the Tories against allegations of electoral fraud, Del Mastro has maintained his innocence and once called the verdict the judge..È opinion. Going into the day..È proceedings, he said he was not worried by the prospect of a jail term.
...I prefer to do whatever..È necessary to stand for the truth,.. he said.
In Ottawa, the New Democrats called Del Mastro the man Harper ...handpicked.. to be his party..È spokesman on ethics and noted other Tories have also been convicted for electoral fraud.
...Conservatives have now been convicted of cheating in every election they won,.. the NDP said in a statement.
Michael Sona, a former Conservative staffer, was convicted last year in the 2011 robocalls scandal. The Conservative Party pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records in the 2006 election.
Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel said he didn..È think Del Mastro..È conviction and sentence would affect the Conservative banner.
...I think Canadians will be able to make the distinction between an individual and a political party,.. he said in Quebec City.
Following the sentencing, Del Mastro..È lawyer expressed disappointment at the punishment. His client, Leo Adler said, was stunned.
...It..È a shock to anybody who has gone through their life without a single criminal blemish to all of a sudden be told that you have to go to jail,.. Adler said outside court.

...Anything short of that would not have adequately denounced these offences,.. Lemon said.
Del Mastro resigned his Peterborough seat in the House of Commons ... where he had been sitting as an Independent since being charged ... shortly after his conviction.
Adler said the appeal would be based on ...substantial errors.. made by the trial judge.

Before entering politics, Alexander, 46, made a name for himself in the world of international diplomacy. He worked in the foreign service for 18 years, posted first to Moscow and later Afghanistan, where he became Canada..È first resident ambassador.
After meeting his wife and starting a family in Kabul, in 2009 he quit diplomacy to return to Canada, where he decided to run for office.

61,0,"Lockheed Martin...s $9 billion purchase of Sikorsky Aircraft, the helicopter manufacturer, is part of a larger effort at Lockheed to focus more intently on military hardware than on less profitable government services.

At the same time that it announced on Monday that it would buy Sikorsky from the United Technologies Corporation, Lockheed also said that it would consider spinning off or selling much of its business that provides information technology services to government agencies.

Lockheed said those parts of its business employ 17,000 people and earn roughly $6 billion in annual sales ... much of it coming from federal agencies outside the military and intelligence communities.

That business generally has lower profit margins than Lockheed..È more traditional work of building satellites, warplanes and missiles, and its sales have dropped in recent years as the government has cut spending on information technology and encouraged more competition from smaller firms. Lockheed said it would continue to supply technical services to military and intelligence customers.

The deal for Sikorsky, which makes the popular Black Hawk helicopters and is based in Stratford, Conn., would further bolster Lockheed..È status as the world..È biggest military contractor by adding another major business line to its varied lines of military equipment, including the F-35 fighter jet.

The transaction will be structured in a way that generates a tax benefit of about $1.9 billion for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders, effectively reducing the purchase price to $7.1 billion, Lockheed says.

The Sikorsky business, which had been part of United Technologies for decades, recorded net sales of $7.5 billion in 2014 and employed more than 15,000 people.

Marillyn Hewson, chairwoman, president and chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said in a news release that Sikorsky was ...a natural fit.. for Lockheed Martin, which had worked on helicopter projects with Sikorsky but did not build helicopters on its own. She added that Lockheed..È reconsideration of its technology services businesses stemmed from the ...recent shifts in market dynamics...

The Sikorsky deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by late fourth quarter 2015 or early first quarter 2016.

The combination of Lockheed and Sikorsky will most likely be scrutinized by the United State Defense Department, which has indicated that it wants to preserve competition among military contractors. Ms. Hewson told analysts on Monday that the company did not expect to run into government opposition since the deal would not reduce the number of companies that make military helicopters.

Boeing, Bell Helicopter and AgustaWestland, which is headquartered in Italy, also build helicopters for the Pentagon.

Lockheed says it expects to add Sikorsky to its Mission Systems and Training business segment after the deal. Sikorsky..È commercial helicopter business has suffered recently, as the drop in oil prices has cut into its business with oil and gas companies.

Bruce Tanner, Lockheed..È chief financial officer, told analysts on Monday that he expected Sikorsky..È business to turn around over the next several years.

The sale came after a review of strategic alternatives for the 90-year-old Sikorsky business that United Technologies conducted this year.

In June, United Technologies said that it was considering selling or spinning off the business this year. That same month, Sikorsky said that it planned to cut up to 1,400 jobs, or about 9 percent of its work force.

Divesting itself of Sikorsky would help simplify the business mix of United Technologies, whose products include Otis elevators, Carrier air-conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines.

Based in Hartford, United Technologies posted net sales of $65.1 billion as of Dec. 31, 2014.

Founded on Long Island in 1925, Sikorsky manufactures and services military and commercial helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. In 1929, it was acquired by the predecessor of United Technologies, United Aircraft and Transport Corporation.

In addition to Black Hawks, Sikorsky makes a range of commercial and military helicopters, including the S-76 and the S-92 commercial helicopters and the Seahawk military helicopter. It is also developing the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter for the Marine Corps and the HH-60W combat rescue helicopter for the Air Force.

Last year, Sikorsky won the contract to build the next generation of Marine One helicopters, which are used to transport the president.

The vote was part of a years-long plan for how to redevelop Mountain View..È North Bayshore area, a mass of low-slung office parks that surrounds Google..È headquarters and is separated from Mountain View proper by Highway 101. At issue was how to allot just over 2 million square feet of future office space, as well as how to build more housing ...- particularly affordable housing ...- in a region that badly needs it.

Google..È proposal was to tear down parts of its campus and replace it with a series of airy buildings with translucent roofs and modular interiors that could be moved around and reconfigured like Lego bricks. It was designed by a superstar duo of Heatherwick Studio, a London design firm known for works like the fiery caldron at the 2012 Olympics, and Bjarke Ingels, a Danish architect known for his innovative designs.

LinkedIn currently leases just under 400,000 square feet in North Bayshore, with a lease that runs out in 2023. Hoping to stay in the area, last year it bought a seven-acre parcel with hopes of developing a new mixed-use development in partnership with a local developer who owns the adjacent land.

That land ...is the singular place in Mountain View where we could eventually develop and have enough space for our company without being encumbered by expensive leases, with rates being driven by companies larger and growing faster than ours,.. said Jim Morgensen, LinkedIn..È vice president of global workplace services, in his 10-minute presentation to the council.

Compared to Google..È clear, space-age headquarters, LinkedIn..È proposal, called the Shoreline Commons, was quite modest. It would be a cluster of offices and retail, including a movie theater and a gym with a pool and a basketball court, along with several bike and pedestrian paths. But modesty was part of the pitch.

...We are doing this without asking for any variances in heights or density, with a project that can be built now with existing technology and union labor,.. Mr. Morgensen told the council. It was a not-so-veiled reference to Google..È plan, which required height exceptions and engineering technologies that have not yet been developed.

LinkedIn also made the savvy move of partnering with an affordable housing developer, which aims to build new housing projects nearby. Google also had plans to develop housing and is still likely play a role in whatever housing plan emerges, as it owns most of the land in North Bayshore.

Despite the vote, this may not be the end of Google..È hope to build something new. They could still tear down some of their property and rebuild to a smaller footprint than what they asked for on Tuesday. Also, the council has set up a process for developers to ask for more office space in the future, so long as it doesn..È add traffic to the area.

64,0,"Over the years, donors gave millions of dollars to the National Children..È Leukemia Foundation, perhaps motivated by brochures or telemarketing pitches describing the charity..È bone marrow registry or its cancer research building.

Neither of those things existed, the New York State attorney general..È office said in a petition filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on Monday.

The petition seeks to shut down the Brooklyn-based foundation and recover money that the attorney general..È office said had been raised fraudulently.

The petition said the foundation had paid exorbitant fees for telemarketing and direct-mail fund-raising campaigns ... more than 80 percent of the $9.7 million that the charity collected from mid-2009 to mid-2013. It paid out only $57,451 in ...direct cash assistance to leukemia patients.. in that time, the documents said.

...Nothing is more shameful than pocketing millions of dollars donated by good-hearted people who just wanted to help children afflicted with a terminal illness,.. the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said.

Even the foundation..È Make a Dream Come True program for children with cancer was mostly a mirage, according to investigators. The foundation..È website, which appears to have been taken down last year, said the program arranged family trips and introductions to celebrities. A telemarketing script used in fund-raising efforts said the program sent children to places like Disney World.

But the court petition said the foundation had spent nothing on the program since March 2009, and only $7,866 in 12 months before that.

Investigators said the foundation amounted to a one-man operation doing business from the basement of a home in the Bergen Beach section of Brooklyn.

That one man, the petition said, was Zvi Shor, who started the foundation in 1991 after losing a son to leukemia. The court papers said Mr. Shor, who ran a construction and plumbing business, had paid himself $595,000 in salary and $600,000 in deferred compensation from 2009 to 2013, along with the promise of a lifetime pension of more than $100,000 a year.

The petition illustrated some of the difficulties of regulating nonprofit organizations, a responsibility that falls to the attorney general..È charities bureau. New York State does not have a law making charities fraud a crime, and criminal prosecutions usually involve larceny, embezzlement or tax fraud.

The foundation..È telephone number has been disconnected, and calls to Mr. Shor..È personal line went unanswered on Monday. Mr. Shor..È lawyer, Douglas Gross, said that he had not seen the petition but that Mr. Shor denied any wrongdoing.

...We do not believe that any of the attorney general..È allegations have any substance,.. Mr. Gross said. ...Mr. Shor began this charity and ran it with the best of intentions...

Mr. Shor..È title was president of the foundation until 2010, when, the court papers said, he ...nominally resigned that position.. after it became known that he had been convicted of bank fraud in 1999.

The court papers said Yehuda Gutwein, the foundation..È accountant, became president but Mr. Shor continued to control the decision-making. Mr. Shor remained so much in charge, the court papers said, that Mr. Gutwein did not know who the foundation..È directors were. When lawyers from the charities bureau handed him a list of the directors, he said he had ...no idea who these people are...

Mr. Gutwein, reached for comment on Monday, said his lawyer would be in touch.

The petition said Mr. Shor admitted to investigators that the foundation never had a registry for bone marrow donors. The court papers said the foundation..È activities about bone marrow work ...were limited to him encouraging callers to become donors, and referring people to their local blood bank...

Mr. Shor also claimed the foundation was ...banking stem cells.. in liquid nitrogen at extremely cold temperatures, the petition said. But he told investigators that the foundation had never collected or stored what is known as cord blood.

The petition said that when Mr. Gutwein became president, Shlomo Donn, who had spent his entire career working for Mr. Gutwein, became the foundation..È accountant. The court papers said that Mr. Donn repeatedly signed financial forms that must be filed with the attorney general..È charities bureau every year, but did no audits.

A call seeking comment on Monday was answered by Mr. Donn..È wife, who said he was not at home and could not be reached.

The petition said the foundation had transferred $655,000 to an Israeli organization that Mr. Shor set up, supposedly for research. Some of the money went to one medical researcher there, the petition said, but the foundation did not provide records showing how much.

In 2012, Mr. Shor and his wife at the time, Susan Gardin, who also worked for the foundation, delivered a PowerPoint presentation in London that showed a building in Israel labeled ...Biomedical Cancer Research Center... But Mr. Shor later told investigators the lettering had been superimposed on the photograph. Ms. Gardin was quoted in the petition as saying that the Israeli organization had bought part of one floor in the building, not the entire building.

The petition also said the foundation had paid for more than $30,000 in personal expenses for Mr. Shor, including $16,615 for gasoline and tolls and $9,000 for supplies used to renovate his house",,,,,,,,23.24,6.12,1.81,4.3,12.68,13.82,4.08,2.38,3.06,0.79,6.68,6.68,0,0,0,0,2.04,0,0

...We..Èe in different businesses. They mass produce their beer and keep it the same every time. We go looking for the craziest ingredients for flavour reasons, not for price reasons,.. said the owner of Indie Ale House in the Junction.
Fisher and several other Ontario microbrewers said they were skeptical about the timing and motives behind Wednesday..È surprise announcement from The Beer store ... the private retailer run by three giant foreign breweries ... to open up ownership to the roughly 100 craft brewers across the province.
Under the changes, Ontario brewers that sell more than five million litres a year would pay $1,000, and smaller brewers $100, to become owners and get one Class E or Class F share. They are also being offered a total of three seats on the 15-member board of directors of the Beer Store. Molson and Labatt would each have five seats on the board and Sleeman two seats.

...It..È obviously a tactic. Many of us in the industry were completely unaware of any of this until this morning,.. said Gary McMullen, president of Muskoka Brewery Inc., which has a staff of 75.
He noted The Beer Store also notified craft brewers last minute about a conference call to get their input on the changes to be held Wednesday evening ... a move he finds odd considering it..È taking place after rather than prior to the sudden announcement.
...We need change at The Beer Store to get equitable market share, but the concept of owning a share in it is kind of laughable for brewers my size,.. said the co-founder of the 19-year-old Bracebridge-based business that annually produces about four million litres of brew including Mad Tom IPA and Hoptorial.
...A ...preferred share..Èwouldn..È get you more than a free ticket to the annual dinner,.. he said with a chuckle.
The Beer Store denied it was trying to head off being charged a fee for its virtual monopoly on beer sales by offering to open up ownership.

The industry association Ontario Craft Brewers told The Canadian Press that the Beer Store announcement about opening ownership ...came as a complete surprise.. and does not address the key issue of improving access for consumers.

Employees dashed to their cars and had no comment Tuesday as they left the head office of the 50-year-old doughnut and coffee behemoth, which is now being run under the Restaurant Brands International umbrella with Burger King after the blockbuster $12.5-billion takeover was completed in December.
Tim Hortons refused to say how many staff will be axed ... or even provide a general number ... despite repeated attempts when contacted as terminations got underway. But recent media speculation is that hundreds of employees of the 2,000 employed outside its restaurants are being let go, which was originally feared when the fast food giants announced the merger last August.

David Macdonald, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said: ...This is not surprising to anyone in the business community. Everyone knows layoffs were very likely to happen after the takeover...
The non-profit think tank had warned there would be widespread layoffs and severe cost-cutting, especially with Burger King..È owner 3G Capital in charge, so as to pay back off debt it took on to make the deal happen. The Brazil-based investment firm has a track record of paring staff and slashing costs to the bone. That..È what happened after it took over Burger King, Heinz and Anheuser-Busch InBev prior to the Tim Hortons acquisition.
Macdonald said franchisees can expect less support from the shrinking head office, along with cutbacks in advertising and other areas.

Industry Canada approved the deal with specific requirements: Burger King must ...maintain significant employment levels.. at the Oakville headquarters and must maintain 100-per-cent staffing levels at franchises across the country.
Earlier this month, two longtime Tims executives abruptly resigned from their new roles in the merged company.
...This comprehensive process has created tremendous opportunities for some of our employees in new roles and promotions,.. Cygal said in her email.
...We greatly appreciate the service and contributions of all of our employees and are treating departing employees with the utmost respect, while providing generous and enhanced severance packages, continuing health benefits and outplacement services...
She confirmed the headquarters will remain in Oakville as promised, ...and our commitment to long-standing brand values and traditions, including our significant community involvement, will continue...
The merger ... which created the world..È third-largest restaurant company, with 18,000 stores and $23 billion in sales ... was originally pitched by executives as the best way to expand Tim Hortons internationally and make the beloved Canadian brand truly global.

Andrew Brenner, of Google..È Android Auto Program, said it tried to minimize distraction during tasks drivers frequently do.Google and Apple Fight for the Car DashboardFEB. 22, 2015
At three years, many consumers are thinking of replacing their vehicles, and many prospective buyers are considering cars just coming off a lease. Durability is cited as the most important reason for choosing a brand or a model, according to J. D. Power. This year..È study included 228 models and 31 brand rankings.

Of owners who had problems with their Bluetooth systems, 55 percent said their vehicle would not recognize their phone and 31 percent said the phone would not automatically connect when they entered the vehicle.

The No. 2 problem was voice recognition systems that misinterpreted commands. Effective voice recognition is seen as a critical function in cars if consumers are to be discouraged from distracted driving. Google and Apple are poised to enter the market widely, with new dashboard computer systems that will allow consumers to use their smartphones.

The study also showed that technology was playing an increasingly important role in buying decisions. Fifteen percent of new-car buyers said they avoided a model because it lacked certain technological features, up from 4 percent in last year..È study.

The study covered 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle systems like exterior, seats, steering, suspension, braking and engine and transmission. J. D. Power then ranked brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.

Lexus was the most reliable brand for the fourth consecutive year. Although Lexus lost that top ranking from 2009 to 2011, it had been on top of the survey for 14 years before that.

In addition to Lexus coming in on top, the 2012 Lexus ES was the most dependable vehicle in the industry, with 79 problems per 100 vehicles.

Toyota Motor Sales, with its Lexus, Toyota and Scion brands, and General Motors, with its Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands, did well. All their brands ranked in the top 10 and above the industry average.

The industry..È average for dependability in this year..È study was 147 problems per 100 vehicles, which was about 1.5 problems per vehicle.

But it is impossible to say whether dependability has improved or declined from last year because the study was substantially redesigned this year.

The industry average ...is in line with what we expected the increase to be with a redesign like this,.. Ms. Stephens said. ...It wasn..È a lot higher, and it wasn..È a lot lower...

Last year..È study found that for the first time since 1998, vehicle dependability declined. a drop that was characterized as ...very significant...

After Lexus (with 89 problems per 100), brands that rounded out the top 10 were Buick (110), Toyota (111), Cadillac (114), Honda and Porsche (in a tie for fifth with 116), Lincoln (118), Mercedes-Benz (119), Scion (121) and Chevrolet and GMC (in a tie for 10th with 123).

In the bottom five were Dodge (192), Mini Cooper (193) and Jeep (197). But the brands with far and away the most problems were Land Rover (258) in 30th place and Fiat (273) at the bottom in 31st.

Scion was the most-improved brand, up 13 spots this year to ninth place. That is because ...every single one of its vehicles was at the top of its segment, just a phenomenal performance,.. Ms. Stephens said.

Ford fell eight places to 25th, from 17th last year, mainly because of the transmission problems in the Ford Focus, Ms. Stephens said. And Ford isn..È the only one.

Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) appear with a flash in their DeLorean time machine from 30 years in the past. Suddenly, they find themselves in the same town, Hill Valley, but surrounded by impossible technology and outlandish social mores.

This collision of science fiction with present-day fact will be marked by a deluge of merchandise, including a new Blu-ray and DVD release packaging the first ...Back to the Future.. with its two sequels, and the animated series. There will also be multiple book retrospectives and a documentary, ...Back in Time...

But still, perhaps this strange world is not so far-fetched after all.

With the benefit of hindsight ... and a closer look ... ...Back to the Future, Part II.. proves surprisingly prescient. Coexisting with inventions and trends that may never come to fruition are those that have now arrived, including the use of drones, eyeglasses as wearable tech, video conferencing, and a focus on urban renewal and green space.

Bob Gale, who wrote and produced the film with the director Robert Zemeckis, discussed their original vision in a telephone interview and explained, ...Bob and I knew we were never going to be accurately predict the future...

At least when it comes to flying cars, Mr. Gale does not mind being wrong. ...People have enough trouble driving in two dimensions,.. he said. ...I don..È think it..È a good idea to give them the Z axis...

Unshackled by the need to become all-knowing futurists, they instead kept their vision hopeful, imagining a 2015 that audiences would want to visit, and they assigned their crew to make that concept a reality.

The visual effects art director John Bell designed many of the fantastical elements. ...I just started taking stabs at anything from the vehicles to the hoverboards to the costumes and town square, where Marty lived,.. Mr. Bell said. That included passing visuals like a drone dog walker.

...We thought that was kind of a joke, but that..È going to happen,.. Mr. Gale said. Another drone appears as a remote photographer for USA Today.

The art team, which was overseen by the production designer Rick Carter, took part in brainstorming sessions to add as many blink-and-you..Èl-miss-them background details as possible. ...We were all just driving to the unknown,.. the costume designer Joanna Johnston said. ...So everyone was going: ...What about this? What about this? But what about this?..È..

For the town square, it was decided that the future Hill Valley would be more forward-thinking in its urban planning. Mr. Gale, Mr. Zemeckis and the production team all believed that community space would be emphasized and old architecture would be maintained, which mirrors the trends in urban design that gave birth to destinations like the High Line in New York. In 1985, the site in front of the Hill Valley clock tower is a parking lot; in 2015, it..È a luscious green park with a lake.

...That town square could exist now,.. Mr. Carter said. ...We..È build upon what was and either turn it, or embrace it...

The residents of Hill Valley also seem to make some strange fashion choices. Mr. Bell and Ms. Johnston exaggerated the designs so that almost everything was asymmetrical and overly colorful. But underlying their choices was another accurate directive from Mr. Zemeckis. ...I was told that people were going to be wearing their athletic clothes all day, which they didn..È then,.. Ms. Johnston said. ...And now they do all the time...

In the McFly household, gadgets permeate every facet of home life. Mr. Carter pointed out that while technology would continually advance, one thing would remain the same: ...If it doesn..È work, it..È just frustrating,.. he said. So the television screen is on the fritz. A retractable garden struggles to follow voice commands. ...Young Marty is exasperated when it doesn..È function perfectly,.. Mr. Carter said.

Some of the gadgets are on the edge of tomorrow, like the Google Glass-like spectacles designed by Doug Chiang. They..Èe used by Marty..È son (played by Mr. Fox) to watch television and his daughter (also played by Mr. Fox) to check on an incoming phone call.

Other on-screen developments, like the fax machine, have seemed archaic for years now. ...We missed the smartphone completely,.. Mr. Gale said. (Though some of the devices in the film work via voice recognition, .¾ la Siri.)

But, when viewed in 2015, it..È that incoming phone call that is, perhaps, the most eye-opening moment. Marty talks to his co-worker Needles (Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers) via a large screen that is essentially an incredible combination of Skype and Facebook. As Needles antagonizes Marty, a running list of personal profile data appears on the bottom of the screen ... from occupation, age, date of birth and address to favorite alcoholic beverages and hobbies. Needles, it turns out, is an ...avid basketball fan... Mr. Gale said this idea came from the assumption that computers would one day contain the information that in the 1980s could be found in a Rolodex.

Marty wonders aloud if their boss is monitoring the call. Sure enough, in a twist that might surprise even Edward J. Snowden and the National Security Agency, Marty..È boss immediately calls him and admits that he was tapped into the conversation the whole time. And this is after the screen reads, ...Thank you for using AT&T...

74,0,"HONG KONG ... It was heralded as the first concrete step taken by the United States and China on the thorny issue of online espionage.

With President Xi Jinping of China beside him at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden last month, President Obama said the two had come to an agreement that China and the United States would refrain from attacks aimed at pilfering company intellectual property or trade secrets for commercial advantage.

Less than a day after that announcement and after Mr. Xi had met in Seattle with the executives of leading American technology companies, a hacking group accused of having links to the Chinese government attacked one such company, looking for trade secrets.

In a blog post on Monday, the security services provider CrowdStrike, based in Irvine, Calif., said that it had tracked a number of attacks on American tech and pharmaceutical companies leading up to and after Mr. Xi..È visit to the United States last month. (Mr. Xi has been logging airtime, making his first state visit to Britain this week.)

...We detected and stopped the actors, so no exfiltration of customer data actually took place,.. according to the post, written by the CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer, Dmitri Alperovitch.

But more problematic, he wrote in the post, was that the attacks had continued in the three weeks since Washington and Beijing signed the security agreement.

The news of further hacking attempts is likely to put new pressure on the countries..Èagreement to limit attacks on private companies. A number of analysts had already expressed skepticism that the accord would lead to concrete changes in a Chinese policy they say has sought for years to plunder secrets from companies in the United States.

In announcing the agreement, Mr. Obama said the United States would be ...watching carefully.. to see if the accord led to progress, and he did not rule out economic sanctions against Chinese companies if the attacks continued.

Of those attacked, ...seven of the companies are firms in the technology or pharmaceuticals sectors, where the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets,.. Mr. Alperovitch wrote in the blog post.

...The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures,.. he added.

According to the CrowdStrike blog post, several of the recent attacks were the responsibility of a group it calls Deep Panda, which the company said it had tracked for many years. Deep Panda often goes after strategic national security targets, but it has also hacked companies in an array of industries, including in agriculture, finance, chemicals and technology.

Mr. Alperovitch did not write that the continued hackings were evidence that the deal had failed, though he called for the Obama administration to explain what it expected the agreement to accomplish.

...The fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected,.. Mr. Alperovitch wrote. ...But we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a time frame for implementation, or, instead, expected it to be immediate...

In one of the first major markers of Chinese action against the attacks, the country arrested a number of hackers who were said to have stolen secrets of United States companies before Mr. Xi..È American visit, according to The Washington Post.

Even so, further attacks were likely to be viewed as a setback. Though China is home to a hard-to-control and diffuse network of state-affiliated hackers, it would probably be fairly simple for Beijing to control a central group like Deep Panda.",,,,,,,,31.2,4.97,1.44,3.53,16.67,10.74,4.81,2.56,3.53,2.4,4.65,5.93,0,0,0,0,1.92,1,0

75,0,"Dollars follow eyeballs. This bedrock principle of media advertising is working against the television industry today, as new viewing patterns challenge old ways of doing business.

The most recent evidence surfaced in August, when one major media company after another reported weaker television advertising revenue. The shares of the companies, including Disney, 21st Century Fox, Viacom and CBS, suffered as Wall Street saw a warning sign that Madison Avenue has recognized for some time.

...The traditional TV model is breaking apart,.. said Laura Desmond, chief executive of Starcom MediaVest, one of the world..È largest ad-buying companies. ...It..È both a crisis and a huge opportunity...

The peril and promise are byproducts of television..È truly becoming a digital medium. Internet services like Netflix and YouTube deliver video programming to screens large and small, in living rooms and on smartphones ... and it is sent ...over the top,.. in industry jargon, via the Internet, sidestepping the TV industry..È accustomed control point, the set-top box. In addition, digital recording services, now offered by cable and satellite TV operators, allow programs to be recorded for later viewing.

The TV market is fracturing and becoming less predictable, undermining the main appeal of traditional TV to advertisers: its ability to deliver mass-market audiences.

Yet as TV embraces digital technology, it opens the door to targeting television ads as never before, much as is done with advertising on the web today.

That helps explain the surge in digital video advertising on Google..È YouTube, Facebook and streaming services like Hulu, where the rules of Internet targeting apply. Those online video ads are only a tenth of the television ad market of $70 billion a year, but they are projected to grow 21 percent a year, according to Forrester Research. By contrast, advertising on cable and broadcast television is expected to inch ahead at 1 percent annually.

Until recently, TV audience information used by advertisers has come mainly from samples of viewers and surveys, conducted by Nielsen and other market research companies. The monitoring made possible by digital technology can be far more detailed ... down to the household level ... not only covering what is being watched but, when combined with other data sources, also predicting behavior and buying habits. ...The Internet was an example of what can be done, but now it is going to TV as well,.. said Shereta Williams, president of Videa, an advertising technology start-up owned by the Cox Media Group.

The technology for digital TV is still in its early stages. The TV industry wants to be able to target ads to households and individuals, as on the web, but without losing control of its distribution network and business.

The set-top box has long been TV..È technical gateway, and that technology is receiving a digital upgrade to give set-top boxes Internet-style targeting capabilities. Today, including satellite TV and cable providers, nearly 40 million set-top boxes are ...household addressable,.. representing about a third of American households.

For advertisers, this should mean more productive ads and the ability to scientifically test their effectiveness. Last year, Starcom MediaVest did an addressable TV ad campaign for Honda..È Acura TLX luxury sedan. The firm combined anonymized sales data and other data to choose 1.7 million households to show Acura ads. Those households..Èrate of buying the cars was more than 60 percent higher than that of a demographically similar control group who were not shown the ads.

With advanced software and data-mining technology, the potential for tailoring ads can be quite refined. So, for example, two households in New York, living in next-door apartments, could watch, say, ...The Good Wife,.. and see different ads. In one apartment, a couple who contribute to environmental causes and have no children could be shown an ad for a compact car. In the other apartment, a couple with two children and a weekend home might be shown an ad for a sport utility vehicle.

The future of TV advertising may be more like web advertising, but it will not be a rerun, analysts and industry executives insist. On the web, some newspaper and magazine publishers have built sizable digital ad businesses. But it has proved to be a winner-take-most marketplace, with the biggest winners being the Internet ad giants Google and Facebook.

...TV will take on some of the characteristics of Internet advertising in terms of targeting and relying on data to predict who is behind the screen,.. said James Nail, an analyst at Forrester Research. ...But video sellers have greater power to dictate how the new technology rolls out...

On traditional television, major consumer product and brand advertisers want their ads to be shown alongside high-quality video programming, mainly the sitcoms and dramas the medium is known for, say the analysts and executives. It is the kind of video environment, they say, that delivers the sight, sound and emotion that drive decision-making.

...Premium content is scarce, and scarcity creates a huge difference between TV and the Internet,.. said Scott Ferber, chief executive of Videology, an ad tech start-up.

The big media companies have used that scarcity to deflect competition in the past. In 2012, Google shut down its Google TV Ads unit after it made little headway in trying to adapt its Internet marketplace model to selling television ads. The TV networks and local stations, analysts say, refused to put the ad inventory they hold for marketers on the Google marketplace.

Today, Google is pursuing a vision of Internet-style ad delivery ... called programmatic TV ... but with a modified approach, portraying itself as a tools maker to assist content providers and marketers.

Google..È role, said Rany Ng, director of product management for video ads, is to ...bring data-driven buying and automation to how television and video advertising is bought...

In recent years, video ad tech start-ups have proliferated, typically specializing in working with the big media companies or ad buyers. They provide software expertise and consulting services and often match buyers and sellers.

...This is so central to the creators..Èand marketers..Èstrategy. They are going to want to be in greater control over time,.. said Bill Day, chief executive of Tremor Video, an ad technology start-up.

For finely tailored ads, data is crucial. So data brokers and data-analysis companies, including Acxiom, Experian and Dunnhumby, are also suppliers to the emerging industry of digital TV.

Acxiom, for example, has demographic, shopping and lifestyle information on every American household. Rick Erwin, its general manager of audience solutions, views digital TV as another market for its targeting services, which are used in direct mail, telemarketing, email and online ads.

...Whenever a medium becomes addressable at the household level, we..Èe the data fuel,.. he said.

For advertisers, the long-term goal is to be able to reach ideal customers for their products, on any screen. The potential, said Mr. Nail of Forrester, is for a TV viewing experience less cluttered with irrelevant ads and ...dramatically improved results for TV advertisers...

But predicting the winners in the high-stakes, high-tech migration to digital TV, analysts and executives agree, is uncertain. Ms. Desmond of Starcom MediaVest, for example, expects a wrenching consolidation in the media business over the next three years or so. The only three sure survivors, she said, are Disney, 21st Century Fox and Comcast NBCUniversal. Smaller players will most likely be bought up.The acquirers, Ms. Desmond said, may well include the Internet powerhouses, like Google and Facebook.

Even those who insist the TV market is unique have their qualms. ...It should be different,.. Mr. Ferber of Videology said, ...but these digital companies are so huge and so powerful, they are going to be hard to resist...",,,,,,,,21.78,4.44,1.01,3.42,13.54,11.13,6.69,2.33,5.84,0.39,4.98,8.72,0.08,0,0,0,2.33,1,1

76,0,"Sometime in the next few years, you will likely have the opportunity to strap on a virtual reality headset and check out a technology that promises to transport the user to another world.
Many companies are planning on launching headsets in the coming year and though early adopters may rush to strap one on, there are still a number of issues that VR has to solve before it can really go mainstream.
...I..È the most optimistic guy about VR out there. I have crazy visions of what we..Èl be doing in the future. But it..È not going to reach hundreds of millions of people in the next three years,"" Palmer Luckey told Recode.
Luckey is the co-founder of Oculus VR, the Facebook-owned company that is largely responsible for kicking off the current wave of interest in VR. Just before E3 last week, Oculus held its own press event where it showed off the commercial version of its VR device, the Rift, and unveiled new hand-held controllers that help people interact in virtual space.
As with any new technology, cost of VR gear is likely to be high initially. While Oculus didn't announce a price, it did release the PC specifications needed to run its headset, estimating that the cost of a computer and a Rift headset might be in the $1,500 range. Sony said its Project Morpheus headset will costs several hundred dollars, and obviously will require a PS4 to work with, which retails for $449 in Canada.
Part of the issue that remains is that extended periods with a poorly calibrated VR set can cause nausea. The immersive nature of VR tricks the brain into seeing a world that doesn..È match what all the user..È senses are registering. That disconnect is what causes nausea.

Many companies are planning on launching virtual reality headsets in the coming year, but there are still a number of issues that VR has to solve before it can really go mainstream.

Hard-core gaming is clearly how VR will make its first real inroads with consumers. But even there, many are taking a wait-and-see approach. Microsoft..È VR Hololens was one of the buzziest E3 onstage demonstrations, but when reviewers actually got to try it out, many were disappointed. It..È a wrap around headset, but the actual field-of-view that the device provides is quite small, which many complained ruined the immersive feel of device ... and immersive feel is what VR is supposed to be all about.
The other big issue is that virtual reality needs to settle before it goes mainstream is settling on a single format. Beyond the video game companies, phone companies such as Samsung and HTC are also creating headsets, meaning choice for consumers, but a potential stumbling block for content creators.
""We haven't seen the commercial release of the hardware. We haven't seen commercial release of any software,.. told BloombergStrauss Zelnick, chief executive officer of Take-Two, makers of Grand Theft Auto told Bloomberg. ""We're intrigued. We're doing a lot of homework. We haven't made any announcements yet. I think it remains to be seen what that format is.""
While gaming companies are experimenting with different experience and extended tech demos, virtual reality will require a new way of game making and figuring out what might work.
Nintendo has yet to announce a VR headset, and one of the company's executives pointed to the fact that it is an isolating experience as being a drawback.
""We have knowledge of the technical space, and we've been experimenting with this for a long, long time,"" said Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime in a Polygon interview. ""What we believe is that, in order for this technology to move forward, you need to make it fun and you need to make it social...
Most people will likely get their first taste of VR in the non-gaming world ... several industries are using the technology to give potential clients a taste of projects that have not yet been built.
At this year's Cannes Lions advertising industry market, The Line, a luxury brand used a VR demo to transport people into its Manhattan store, The Apartment. Marriott Hotels has trotted out a booth rigged (dubbed the ...teleporter..) with a VR headset to take people on virtual tours around the world. At this month..È Paris Air Show, Boeing used Google..È Cardboard VR headsets to give people a virtual tour of their new planes.
Closer to home, Fort York is working on a virtual tourism project, designed to give people a taste of the site..È historic past.

MPPs from all three parties voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to pass the Making Healthier Choices Act, banning flavoured tobacco, limiting e-cigarettes, and forcing fast-food chains to put calorie counts on their menus.
Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla said the legislation, which passed by a vote of 100-1, will ...lower smoking rates and fight obesity...
But amid concerns over the curbs on e-cigarettes, which some health activists believe are helpful in smoking cessation efforts, Damerla stressed the government is not outlawing ...vaping...
...We..Èe not banning electronic cigarettes, we..Èe simply regulating them,.. she said, noting the sale of e-cigarettes to those 19 and under will be prohibited.
At the same time, it will be illegal to use e-cigarettes in non-smoking areas and to promote or display them for sale.
But Damerla said she..È ...leaving the door open.. to them as a smoke-cessation product like nicotine patches if further research proves they are effective.
...We can..È have it promoted as a cool product,.. she said, emphasizing the government doesn..È want teens starting to vape.
All flavoured tobacco products will be forbidden with menthol being given a two-year reprieve.
NDP MPP France Gelinas (Nickel Belt), who has pushed the moves for seven years, said the new law ...will save lives.. in Ontario.
But Progressive Conservative MPP Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington), the lone dissenter, expressed concern that the vaping measures might actually have the opposite effect.

79,0,"Facebook is running a new batch of TV commercials, but that..È one front where Hubub has the social media giant beat. The Toronto-based start-up had a Super Bowl commercial in Canada that is still airing, introducing people to its new social platform.
So what the heck is a Hubub? With the tag line, ...Your Interest Internet,.. it is a topic-based site that wants to become a place where users discuss things online. People sign on and create or follow Hububs for all kinds of interests, from Sports Brawls to Human Rights in Korea. What makes this site different is beyond comments, there..È a rich media experience: users can post images, blogs, articles and polls, and pose questions for debate.
...It is bit like Facebook..È newsfeed without all the other crap around,.. says Robert Oh, Hubub..È product lead.
Or another take: ...It..È sort of like a chat room on steroids, but much more.. says founder Peter Corsell.
That TV commercial came partly thanks to a $5 million equity stake from Bell Media, which also has marketing and monetization rights to Hubub in Canada and hopes that its investment will grow exponentially if the 46-person company becomes the next big online thing.
The site aims to increase user engagement, and there may be an opportunity, as online commenting and chat rooms haven..È evolved much, even though they are clearly used. The problem: they..Èe not areas where people have figured out how to make money. For most media companies, commenting is a troublesome must have.
That..È where Hubub sees an opportunity. While the company has created it..È own site housing topic pages, Hububs can also be placed on other sites. Thanks to Bell, users will start seeing more of these, starting on Monday with TSN..È NHL trade deadline coverage. This is a high-traffic date for the network..È TradeCentre; instead of the regular comments section at the bottom of the page, users will find a Hubub.
...Because we have a large marketing machine ... a megaphone, we like to call it ... we can invest in smaller guys, and help them along,.. says Jeff Hersh, director of strategy and business development at Bell Media. Hubub ...is a very interesting opportunity, as it plays in the social and search areas.
...Do we know it..È going to be a sure success? No, but all the big online players are international, so you do have start at an earlier stage in Canada if you want to get in on these opportunities...
Something like Hubub needs highly engaged users to exist; in particular, it needs people who want to curate content into Hububs, as well as those who want to read them.
Chantal Bechervaise saw a commercial and decided to check it out. Already heavily involved in social media, she created the Everything to do with Leadership, Human Resources and Social Media Hubub. She..È been using it for about six weeks.
...I use it as an extension of my brand. I use social media for branding and thought leadership, and I blog, so I found it an opportunity to get more readers,.. she says. ...What I like about it, unlike Facebook or Twitter, is when you post something, it lasts longer. When you create a page, it is a bit like Pinterest. When you pin something, it stays there...
With 17,000 views on Hubub, Becervaise says she likes how it has driven traffic to her blog.
Hubub is still working on its technology, building up topic pages and finding ways to work with Bell properties. But the path to monetization comes from eventually providing advertising opportunities. The company wants to work with brands to create content they would share on pages. Similar to Buzzfeed, it..È a native advertising play ... ads that look like content ... that curators can decide to post.
For example, if a user created a home renovation Hubub that garnered a large following, Hubub could convince a hardware store to make a how-to video, which it would offer to the Hubub owner to post.
Other users can create rival Hububs in the same topic area, effectively competing for readers and monetization opportunities. It is an idea similar to Foursquare, where users can usurp others by checking in at certain places more often.
That requires a high level of sophistication from both brands and users, not to mention content good enough to pull people away from more established discussion zones, such as Reddit.
...Brands are already realizing they have to get better as creating that kind of content,.. says Corsell. ...The great part of this is that content will be in a place people are looking for it...
Right now, Hubub is in the user acquisition phase, and there is no mention of longer-term plans for monetization on the site. Corsell and his team admit a need for a way to explain their longer-term plans. For a start, though, the company needs users to get the conversation going.

You may not see them on shelves anytime soon, but they are among the inventions that Apple protected in 2014 as it took in a bumper crop of new patents.
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple 2,003 utility patents, which recognize new and useful processes and machines. That..È a 13 per cent increase over 2013 and more than triple the company..È 2010 haul, according to IFI Claims, a patent analysis firm.
The steady increase in patents comes as Apple is doubling down on research and development, pouring $6 billion into its labs in fiscal year 2014, which ended in September. The investments suggest the company is laying the groundwork to find its next lucrative products, recognizing that it can..È coast if it wants to stay in investors..Ègood graces, Gartner analyst Van Baker said.
...When you..Èe that big, and you want to continue to grow at a rate that the market is going to reward, you have to expand your business,.. he said.
Although companies commonly patent ideas they do not ultimately use, the evolving makeup of Apple..È portfolio points to spaces the company may be mining for future growth. Among other areas, the company has amassed more intellectual property related to television, a household staple ripe for reinvention, and cybersecurity, one of the tech industry..È greatest headaches after a series of worrisome hacks.
The tech titan..È burgeoning patent portfolio mirrors a shift underway in Silicon Valley and across the globe as companies worldwide are racing to protect nearly everything their engineers come up with, said Larry Cady, vice president of product marketing at IFI Claims.
Grants climbed more than 8 per cent to cross the 300,000 threshold for the first time in 2014, with many companies besting their records.
Apple ranked 11th on IFI..È list of top patent recipients and, in the Bay Area of California, second only to Google, which took eighth place with 2,566 patents in 2014, up nearly 39 per cent from the previous year.
IBM brought home the most patents, as it has for 22 years running, and valley stalwarts such as Hewlett-Packard and Cisco also showed solid gains, upping their tallies by 16 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.
A patent gives a company the right to use an invention exclusively for a limited period of time. But the trade-off is that the firm must offer up a glimpse of what it is working on, which is notoriously hard to come by at Apple headquarters.
A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the company..È patents.
According to data supplied by IFI, the types of technology for which Apple won the most patents in 2014 were computer graphics, mobile communications and computer software. That suggests the company is continuing to focus on its strengths, such as the powerhouse iPhone, which drives more than half its sales.
But the company also has steadily earned more patents related to television, bringing home 73 in 2014, up from 28 in 2012 and a mere eight in 2011, according to IFI. That may be good news for Apple fans and investors who have long been waiting for the company to reimagine the television set.
One patent granted in December describes technology that would stream content simultaneously on a fixed device such as an Apple TV and a portable gadget such as a smartphone, letting users leave their living rooms to grab snacks without missing a moment of their favourite shows. Another patent describes a new-age wand that users would wave to pick shows, rather than clicking old-fashioned remotes.
The company..È patent portfolio also suggests a growing interest in security, with grants related to information security climbing 44 per cent to 39 patents and grants related to cryptography climbing 25 per cent to 15 patents, according to IFI. The company must keep security top of mind as it designs its gadgets, Baker noted.
...It..È an important consideration in mobile devices because we..Èe living in a world where there are more and more threats in terms of malware, cyberespionage, identity theft and hacks,.. he said.
When it comes to Apple, the faintest possibility of a new device is enough to cause investors to sit up and take notice. Patently Apple, a blog that tracks patent filings from Apple, recently spotted that the company had earned a patent for a wearable video camera that sounded a lot like GoPro..È specialty. The action-camera maker..È stock sank about 12 per cent on the news.
Regardless of what Apple has cooking in its tightly veiled labs, experts say it is encouraging to see patent grants and R&D spending on the rise.

But now scientists have begun extracting DNA from human bones, and the findings are providing new glimpses at the history of the first Americans. On Monday, researchers at the University of Alaska and elsewhere published an important addition to the growing genetic archive.

In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reported that they had recovered DNA from two skeletons of children who lived in Alaska 11,500 years ago. The genetic material is not only among the oldest ever found in the Americas, but also the first ancient DNA discovered in Beringia, the region around the Bering Strait where many researchers believe Asians first settled before spreading through North and South America.

In 2011, archaeologists discovered cremated bones on a hearth at the site. Research revealed that the bones belonged to a 3-year-old child. Below the hearth, the team discovered a burial pit containing the skeletons of two other children.

One of the buried children was an infant who died a few months after birth; the other was likely a late-term fetus. After the baby and the fetus died, their bodies were carefully laid atop a bed of red ocher, surrounded by antlers fashioned into hunting darts.

...These things we hardly ever find ... it..È a very rare window into the worldview of these people,.. said Ben A. Potter, an archaeologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who has led the research at Upward Sun River.

Clearly, the children had been ceremonially buried. But why the two bodies ended up in the same grave is impossible to know. With the consent of Native American tribes that live around the site, Dr. Potter and his colleagues drilled small pieces of bone from the two skeletons and sent them to geneticists at the University of Utah.

The vast majority of our DNA lies in the nucleus of the cell. But the cell..È energy factories, called mitochondria, also carry small bits of their own DNA inherited solely from our mothers.

Because each cell can contain hundreds of mitochondria, it is easier to reconstruct their DNA than that of the cellular nuclei. The Utah geneticists focused their search on mitochondrial DNA in the Upward Sun River bones.

They succeeded in recovering mitochondrial DNA from both bone samples. But to their surprise, the genes were markedly different. The infant and the fetus did not share the same mother or even maternal grandmother.

The researchers can only speculate how an infant and a fetus from different mothers ended up in the same grave. They might have had the same father, or they might have belonged to different families who suffered terrible losses at the same time.

But the significance of the DNA found at Upward Sun River extends far beyond the story of two children. It sheds light on how people first moved into the Americas.

In 2007, Ripan Malhi of the University of Illinois and his colleagues proposed a model for this migration, known as the Beringian Standstill. Early Siberians expanded east into Beringia about 25,000 years ago, they proposed, and stayed there for about 10,000 years.

Humans were able to thrive in Beringia because even at the height of the last ice age, the region was not covered by glaciers. It was mainly tundra and shrub land, with scattered stands of trees.

Humans could not expand eastward into the rest of the Americas because they were blocked by glaciers. About 15,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the standstill came to an end.

...It opened up new ecological zones that were being colonized by plants and animals,.. said Dennis O..Èourke of the University of Utah, a co-author of the new study.

According to the standstill hypothesis, the ancestors of Native Americans would have built up a large degree of genetic diversity in the thousands of years they were confined to Beringia ... more so than if these populations had migrated directly from Siberia to the Americas.

The fact that two children who died at roughly the same time in the same community shared so few genes is consistent with the idea that the population was prevented from moving into the Americas for thousands of years, Dr. O..Èourke said.

But the two children died after the glaciers melted, he noted, and their settlement ...may well be a remnant of that original Beringian group. It may give us a snapshot of that earlier time...

Dr. Malhi, who was not involved in the new study, thought the new DNA was too recent to provide proof of the idea that humans were trapped in Beringia for thousands of years. ...It..È valuable information, but it..È a little bit late to be extremely informative to let us know if the Beringian Standstill hypothesis holds,.. he said.

More conclusive findings would be possible if scientists found older DNA from people who lived during the Beringian Standstill. Archaeologists are now looking for skeletons from that age, but Dr. Malhi is not holding his breath.

Many of the sites where people lived may now be impossible to reach, because sea levels rose at the end of the ice age.

..There are archaeologists up there looking for such sites,.. Dr. Malhi said. ...But I think it..È probably unlikely, largely because a lot of Beringia is now under water...",,,,,,,,21.21,6.06,2.53,3.54,15.4,9.93,4.29,3.62,5.72,0.51,5.39,5.39,0.17,0.08,0,0,1.09,0,0

83,0,"Bird eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm, a process called polyspermy. Penetration by multiple sperm may be unusual in the animal kingdom, but it is somehow crucial to the development of the bird embryo, a new study finds.

...In humans and mammals, you only need one sperm to penetrate the egg,.. said Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield and one of the study..È authors. ...If there..È more than one, it can be lethal and we end up with the embryo dying...

Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues studied eggs from zebra finches and chickens. They inseminated the finches with low doses of sperm, from one to 15, and compared this result with naturally fertilized eggs, which may be fertilized by 10 to hundreds of sperm.

Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues also inseminated chickens with a low dose of sperm: approximately 10,000. Other chickens were inseminated with 10 million sperm.

The researchers found that when few sperm penetrated the egg, the bird embryo was unlikely to survive. They report their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Exactly why the extra sperm are needed is unknown.

...Although the sperm do seem to be required for the embryo to survive, we don..È know how they contribute to the process of fertilization,.. Dr. Hemmings said. Extra sperm may somehow support cell cycles necessary for early embryo development.

84,0,"Those big brown eyes gaze at you, deeply. Your heart leaps. You caress, murmuring sweet nothings. And as those big browns remain fixed on you, the tail wags.

Devoted dog. Besotted owner. That continuous loop of loving reinforcement may begin with the dog..È gaze, according to a new report in Science.

Japanese researchers found that dogs who trained a long gaze on their owners had elevated levels of oxytocin, a hormone produced in the brain that is associated with nurturing and attachment, similar to the feel-good feedback that bolsters bonding between parent and child. After receiving those long gazes, the owners..Èlevels of oxytocin increased, too.

The dog..È gaze cues connection and response in the owner, who will reward the dog by gazing, talking and touching, all of which helps solder the two, the researchers said. They suggest that dogs became domesticated in part by adapting to a primary human means of contact: eye-to-eye communication.

And when researchers gave dogs extra oxytocin through a nasal spray, the female dogs (though not the males) gazed at their owners even longer, which in turn boosted the owners..Èoxytocin levels.

...What..È unique about this study is that it demonstrates that oxytocin can boost social gaze interaction between two very different species,.. said Steve Chang, an assistant professor of psychology and neurobiology at Yale who was not involved in this latest research.

Dr. Chang, who studies oxytocin in animals, noted that through domestication, dogs came to regard humans as their ...key social partners,.. while humans also came to view dogs as social partners.

...In a way, domesticated dogs could hijack our social circuits, and we can hijack their social circuits,.. he said in an email, as each species learned how to raise the other..È oxytocin levels, facilitating connection.

The researchers also tested wolves raised by humans to see whether a wolf-to-owner gaze would raise oxytocin levels in either or both. But compared with dogs, the wolves scarcely gazed at their owners, and the owners..Èoxytocin levels barely budged.

Unlike dogs, wolves ...tend to use eye contact as a threat.. and are inclined to ...avoid human eye contact,.. wrote Miho Nagasawa, a study author and research fellow at Jichi Medical University.

In an email, Dr. Takefumi Kikusui, a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine at Azabu University, wrote that he believes that the differences in gaze between dogs and wolves means ...that dogs have acquired this superior ability during the evolutionary and domestication process of living with humans...

He continued: ...There is a possibility that dogs cleverly and unknowingly utilized a natural system meant for bonding a parent with his or her child...

In the first experiment, researchers measured oxytocin levels in the urine of 30 owners and dogs before and after they interacted for 30 minutes. The dogs were males and females, spayed, neutered and intact. The breeds included Golden retrievers, standard poodles, miniature Dachshunds, miniature Schnauzers, a Jack Russell Terrier, and two mixed breed. They also measured oxytocin in five wolves and their owners.

The changes in oxytocin were most pronounced in dogs who fixed longer gazes on their owners, which researchers defined as 100 seconds in the first five minutes of the encounter. They saw no significant difference in oxytocin levels among the breeds or sex of the dogs.

In the second experiment, researchers administered nasal sprays of either saline or oxytocin to dogs. This time, each dog entered a room with three humans: its owner and two strangers. But now, only the female dogs who were given the oxytocin displayed an even longer gaze at their owners, who in turn had spikes in their oxytocin levels. Researchers could not say why the sex of the dog mattered. But they speculated that vigilance in male dogs, set off by the presence of the two strangers, may have moderated the effects of oxytocin.

Other experts on canine behavior expressed caution about overstating the implications of this study.

Dr. Alexandra Horowitz, director of the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, called the study ...a fascinating direction of research, because it looks at connections between behavioral measures and hormonal components... She noted that it raised many intriguing questions: about long and short gazes; why only female dogs reacted to the oxytocin dose; whether other breeds would yield different results. But pointing to the small size of the sample, she added, ...I don..È know how it proves the domestication thesis...

And then there is the meaning of a dog..È ...gaze... The human gaze is layered with nuance. Dog owners may ascribe similar complexity to their dog..È gaze, certain that they, like parents, can interpret it. (A view endorsed by this owner of a Havanese, whose eager, soulful gaze is both long and expressive, punctuated by cocking his head, and fluttering his ears forward. Speaks volumes.) ...If your dog..È gaze helps you think your dog understands you,.. said Dr. Horowitz, ...that produces bonding...

But Evan L. MacLean, co-director of the Duke Canine Cognition Center and a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study, said, ...We don..È know what the dog..È gaze means. When you look at a human baby, it feels good. Maybe dogs gaze at you because it feels good. Maybe the dogs are hugging you with their eyes?..

But Dr. MacLean, an evolutionary anthropologist, said that fundamentally, for dogs, human behavior is ...the telltale of everything that is about to happen... Are we going to stand or sit? Leave the room? Bring food?

And so they stare at us, fixedly.

85,0,"Acting on a tip from spelunkers two years ago, scientists in South Africa discovered what the cavers had only dimly glimpsed through a crack in a limestone wall deep in the Rising Star Cave: lots and lots of old bones.

The remains covered the earthen floor beyond the narrow opening. This was, the scientists concluded, a large, dark chamber for the dead of a previously unidentified species of the early human lineage ... Homo naledi.

The new hominin species was announced on Thursday by an international team of more than 60 scientists led by Lee R. Berger, an American paleoanthropologist who is a professor of human evolution studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The species name, H. naledi, refers to the cave where the bones lay undisturbed for so long; ...naledi.. means ...star.. in the local Sesotho language.

In two papers published this week in the open-access journal eLife, the researchers said that the more than 1,550 fossil elements documenting the discovery constituted the largest sample for any hominin species in a single African site, and one of the largest anywhere in the world. Further, the scientists said, that sample is probably a small fraction of the fossils yet to be recovered from the chamber. So far the team has recovered parts of at least 15 individuals.

...With almost every bone in the body represented multiple times, Homo naledi is already practically the best-known fossil member of our lineage,.. Dr. Berger said.

The finding, like so many others in science, was the result of pure luck followed by considerable effort.

Two local cavers, Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker, found the narrow entrance to the chamber, measuring no more than seven and a half inches wide. They were skinny enough to squeeze through, and in the light of their headlamps they saw the bones all around them. When they showed the fossil pictures to Pedro Boshoff, a caver who is also a geologist, he alerted Dr. Berger, who organized an investigation.

Just getting into the chamber and bringing out samples proved to be a huge challenge. The narrow opening was the only way in.

Paul Dirks, a geologist at James Cook University in Australia, who was lead author of the journal paper describing the chamber, said the investigators first had a steep climb up a stone block called the Dragon..È Back and then a drop down to the entrance passage ... all of this in the total absence of natural light.

For the two extended investigations of the chamber in 2013 and 2014, Dr. Berger rounded up the international team of scientists and then recruited six excavating scientists through notices on social media. One special requirement: They had to be slender enough to crawl through that crack in the wall.

One of the six, who were all women and were called ...underground astronauts,.. was Marina Elliott of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. She said the collection and removal of the fossils involved ...some of the most difficult and dangerous conditions ever encountered in the search for human origins...

Besides introducing a new member of the prehuman family, the discovery suggests that some early hominins intentionally deposited bodies of their dead in a remote and largely inaccessible cave chamber, a behavior previously considered limited to modern humans. Some of the scientists referred to the practice as a ritualized treatment of their dead, but by ...ritual.. they said they meant a deliberate and repeated practice, not necessarily a kind of religious rite.

...It..È very, very fascinating,.. said Ian Tattersall, an authority on human evolution at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who was not involved in the research.

...No question there..È at least one new species here,.. he added, ...but there may be debate over the Homo designation, though the species is quite different from anything else we have seen...

A colleague of Dr. Tattersall..È at the museum, Eric Delson, who is a professor at Lehman College of the City University of New York, was also impressed, saying, ...Berger does it again!..

Dr. Delson was referring to Dr. Berger..È previous headline discovery, published in 2010, also involving cave deposits near Johannesburg. He found many fewer fossils that time, but enough to conclude that he was looking at a new species, which he named Australopithecus sediba. Geologists said the individuals lived 1.78 million to 1.95 million years ago, when australopithecines and early species of Homo were contemporaries.

Researchers analyzing the H. naledi fossils have not yet nailed down their age, which is difficult to measure because of the muddled chamber sediments and the absence of other fauna remains nearby. Some of its primitive anatomy, like a brain no larger than an average orange, Dr. Berger said, indicated that the species evolved near or at the root of the Homo genus, meaning it must be in excess of 2.5 million to 2.8 million years old. Geologists think the cave is no older than three million years.

The field work and two years of analysis for Dr. Berger..È latest discovery were supported by the University of the Witwatersrand, the National Geographic Society and the South African Department of Science and Technology/National Research Foundation. In addition to the journal articles, the findings will be featured in the October issue of National Geographic Magazine and in a two-hour NOVA/National Geographic documentary to air Wednesday on PBS.

Scientists on the discovery team and those not involved in the research noted the mosaic of contrasting anatomical features, including more modern-looking jaws and teeth and feet, that warrant the hominin..È placement as a species in the genus Homo, not Australopithecus, the genus that includes the famous Lucy species that lived 3.2 million years ago. The hands of the newly discovered specimens reminded some scientists of the earliest previously identified specimens of Homo habilis, who were apparently among the first toolmakers.

At a news conference on Wednesday, John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a senior author of the paper describing the new species, said it was ...unlike any other species seen before,.. noting that a small skull with a brain one-third the size of modern human braincases was perched atop a very slender body. An average H. naledi was about five feet tall and weighed almost 100 pounds, he said.

Tracy Kivell of the University of Kent, in England, an associate of Dr. Berger..È team, was struck by H. naledi..È ...extremely curved fingers, more curved than almost any other species of early hominin, which clearly demonstrates climbing capabilities...

William Harcourt-Smith of Lehman College, another researcher at the Museum of Natural History, led the analysis of the feet of the new species, which he said are ...virtually indistinguishable from those of modern humans... These feet, combined with its long legs, suggest that H. naledi was well suited for upright long-distance walking, Dr. Harcourt-Smith said.

In an accompanying commentary in the journal, Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, found overall similarities between the new species and fossils from Dmanisi, in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, dated to about 1.8 million years ago. The Georgian specimens are usually assigned to an early variety of Homo erectus.

Much remains to be discovered in the Rising Star Cave, like determining the ages of the fossils and the evolutionary position of H. naledi in the genus Homo and the human family tree. The discovery chamber has not given up all of its secrets. ...There are potentially hundreds if not thousands of remains of H. naledi still down there,.. Dr. Berger said.

At the news conference in South Africa on Thursday announcing the findings, Dr. Berger said: ...I do believe that the field of paleoanthropology had convinced itself, as much as 15 years ago, that we had found everything, that we were not going to make major discoveries and had this story of our origins figured out. I think many people quit exploring, thought it was safer to conduct science inside a lab or behind a computer... What the new species Naledi says, Dr. Berger concluded, ...is that there is no substitute for exploration...",,,,,,,,23.36,5.97,2.2,3.76,15.11,8.37,3.76,3.31,5.77,0.19,5.9,6.74,0.19,0.06,0,0.06,2.2,1,0

86,0,"A new study suggests that joining a religious group could do more for someone..È ...sustained happiness.. than other forms of social participation, such as volunteering, playing sports or taking a class.
A study in the American Journal of Epidemiology by researchers at the London School of Economics and Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands found that the secret to sustained happiness lies in participation in religion.
...The church appears to play a very important social role in keeping depression at bay and also as a coping mechanism during periods of illness in later life,.. Mauricio Avendano, an epidemiologist at LSE and an author of the study, said in a statement. ...It is not clear to us how much this is about religion per se, or whether it may be about the sense of belonging and not being socially isolated...
Researchers looked at four areas: volunteering or working with a charity; taking educational courses; participating in religious organizations and participating in a political or community organization.
Of the four, participating in a religious organization was the only social activity associated with sustained happiness, researchers found. The study analyzed 9,000 Europeans who were over the age of 50.
The report also found that joining political or community organizations lose their benefits over time. In fact, the short-term benefits from those social connections often lead to depressive symptoms later on, researchers say.
Although healthier people are more likely to volunteer, the researchers found no evidence that volunteering actually leads to better mental health. Benefits could be outweighed by other negative impacts of volunteering, such as stress, Avendano said.
The researchers noted that it is unclear whether the benefits of participating in a religious organization are connected to being in the religious community or to the faith itself.

... Sir Arthur Doughty, former chief archivist of Canada
Maybe the muzzling of climate scientists did pay off for Harper and Tories who didn..È want Canadians to spend too much time thinking about the climate: from 2007 to 2012, the volume of media coverage of climate change issues fell by 80 per cent.
When the Harper government held closed-door meetings to talk about ways to cut Environment Canada..È budget by $60 million in the 2012 federal budget, Harper..È team made sure communications specialists were in the room. Records labelled ...secret advice to the minister.. were part of 500 pages of briefing material prepared for a new deputy minister when she arrived at Environment Canada a few months after the meetings.
...Strategists from the communication branch were involved in Environment Canada..È deliberations on its contribution to the deficit action reduction plan from the beginning,.. said the records, released through Access to Information. They also showed that Environment Canada..È human resources branch managers stayed in touch with both the Prime Minister..È Office and the Privy Council Office.
...That sounds a bit backwards to me,.. Gary Corbett, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, which represents about 60,000 government scientists and professionals, told Postmedia journalist Mike De Souza. ...It..È wrong for communications people to be involved in deciding what decisions to make. Communications people are there to communicate the decisions after they..Èe made. It seems the government is just being political rather than [doing] what..È in the best interests of Canadians...
The Harper government is especially sensitive about any scientific research that shows the extraction of oil from the bitumen sands of northern Alberta is a threat to the environment or to people. Environment Canada researchers Derek Muir and Jane Kirk agreed with findings by University of Alberta scientists Erin Kelly and David Schindler that contaminants are accumulating in snow near the oilsands quarries. While the university scientists could discuss their findings with the media, the government scientists could not.
The University of Alberta scientists..Èreport was presented in November 2011 at a conference in Boston of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. ...[Environment Canada..È] research conducted during winter 2010...11 confirms results already published by the University of Alberta that show contaminants in snow in the oilsands area,.. an Environment Canada memorandum admitted, but the authors of the document warned: ...If scientists are approached for interviews at the conference, the EC [Environment Canada] communications policy will be followed by referring the journalist to the media relations . . . phone number. An appropriate spokesperson will then be identified depending on journalist questions...
The document was obtained through Access to Information by Postmedia..È Mike De Souza, who had been bird-dogging the government on its cover-up of data that might cause trouble for oil extraction companies. (Their problem was solved when De Souza was laid off in 2014, when Postmedia shut down its Ottawa bureau. The Postmedia chain no longer has a full-time environment reporter on Parliament Hill.)
Environment Canada scientists were told to say, ...I am a scientist. I..È not in a position to answer that question, but I..È be happy to refer you to an appropriate spokesperson... The official line was: ...We are comparing the levels of contamination we found in our work to other studies and find that other studies report both higher and lower levels. These efforts will allow us to better understand deposition patterns and levels of oilsands related contaminants with a view to better identify their sources and ecological risks...
By the sixth year of the Harper regime, most scientists knew it was foolish and dangerous to try to buck the system. The Index on Censorship took a survey of 4,000 Canadian scientists in 2013. Only 14 per cent said they felt they would be able to share a concern about public health and safety, or a threat to the environment, without fear of retaliation or censure from their department or agency.
Once the Harper government had scientists under its control, it went after their research libraries. First, Health Canada turned over its interlibrary loan system to a company called Infotrieve. Every time a researcher wanted material from a scientific journal article, a book from a university library or a publication from a federal or provincial agency, Infotrieve billed the scientist..È department. To save money and aggravation, some research scientists started borrowing university library cards from co-op students and friends who taught in universities so they could get the interlibrary loan material for free. Others had to ask friends working for private companies to get government-owned research material for them.
Health Canada..È head office library was shut down. The books and journals, essential for serious research, were sent to the National Science Library on the Ottawa campus of the National Research Council in 2013. Rudi Mueller, who left Health Canada in 2012, says the department simply did not want it to be easy for scientists to use libraries. ...I look at it as an insidious plan to discourage people from using libraries,.. Mueller said. ...If you want to justify closing a library, you make access difficult and then you say it is hardly used...
Scientists like Mueller were not just kept away from books. They were also unable to get help from trained science librarians who know how to track down publications that are obscure, rare or hard to get. Health Canada had 40 of these librarians. In April 2013, it had six. ...A librarian is far better at doing a literature search than I am,.. Mueller said. ...It..È their profession... Mueller said the research support system had become absurd and, by the end of his career with Health Canada, he believed he wasn..È able to do his work properly.
At least one Health Canada scientist started his own library, squirrelling away 250 feet of shelf space worth of books and journals in his basement. Friends who work for the department email him with requests, and the scientist tracks the material down and brings it to work.
If the plan was designed to save money, it..È been a failure. Health Canada Library Services had a staff of 36 and a budget of $1.75 million in 2008...2009. In 2013...2014 there was a staff of six and the cost had risen to $2.67 million. On top of that, each time a Health Canada scientist needs a document, the department has to pay a $25.65 retrieval fee plus the courier bill from the National Science Library. Scientists are charged $9 for a scanned, emailed document.
Former Green Party activist Katie Gibbs, who holds a PhD in biology specializing in conservation science, organized the Death of Evidence marches in 2012. She believes the Harper government doesn..È want to hear from scientists, even those who work in the federal bureaucracy. ...I think there are multiple ways to avoid using scientific evidence in policy development. One way is to not collect it and get rid of historical documentary information,.. Gibbs said.
...A picture does say a thousand words. You see pictures of dumpsters full of books. It..È alarming. You see lots of examples of private companies picking up these books. I..Èe heard from so many scientists who took the material home because they couldn..È stand to see this material thrown out. Scientists are sending out emails to each other saying what they have stored away. It..È having an impact on the ability of scientists to do their job,.. she said.
Historians have faced the same kind of cuts. In Harper..È Canada, history comes from the Centre, not from the work of the professors and authors who depend on easy access to the vast collection of documents and pictures at Library and Archives Canada (LAC). Inside its Ottawa building, just a block from Parliament Hill, services have been slashed, employee morale is dismal and visiting scholars are angry.
The words ...dusty.. and ...archives.. are usually used in the same breath by people who don..È understand that history is a living thing that can, and often is, remade to suit political agendas. History is also often hidden by governments that want to write their own narrative of what a country..È about. The archives is so poor that it..È missed out on important historical letters, a collection of narratives from fugitive slaves in Upper Canada from 1856, and letters from British colonial officials on the state of First Nations in eastern Canada during pioneer times. In 2008...2009, Library and Archives Canada spent $385,461 on historic documents. In 2011...2012 it spent nothing. In Washington, the Library of Congress..È acquisition budget was between $18 million and $19 million annually from 2009 to 2012.
In the early years of this century, Library and Archives Canada started working on a project to make its collection accessible to everyone. First, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King..È diary and documents from New France were posted on the Internet. Probably the department..È heart was in the right place, but the plan has been a failure. Six years into the digitalization project, there was very little to show for it except frustration, with LAC staff and managers unable to get the system running properly and Canadians finding it not very helpful.
When people have asked for material that is politically sensitive, Library and Archives Canada, prompted by its overseers in the Heritage Ministry and the Prime Minister..È Office, has dug in its heels. Since 2005, Canadian Press reporter Jim Bronskill has been trying to see the RCMP security service file on one-time federal NDP leader and Saskatchewan premier Tommy Douglas, who died in 1986. The file is 1,149 pages thick, but Bronskill received just 400 heavily censored pages when he filed his first request. Library and Archives Canada released another 300 pages of the file just before Bronskill..È case was heard by the Federal Court, and Bronskill got some more of the file after the court ruled in his favour. The material that has been released shows the country..È national police force tailed a mainstream elected politician for almost 60 years and watched him long after he retired to see if he was involved with communists, members of the peace movement or anyone else identified by the police as a danger to the state.
The federal government outsourced some of the archives..Èwork to ancestry.ca, a for-profit website used by genealogists. People can go to the archives building and use this service without paying, but if they to want use census material from the comfort of their home, they..È better have their credit card handy.
To do the job right, a national archives still needs archivists ... many of them skilled historians ... to help professional and amateur researchers who come to Ottawa to use the collection. But rather than increase Library and Archives Canada..È budget so it can do its job, the Harper government has cut it. It may scold Canadians and immigrants for not knowing their history, but it has made it much harder for people to study and write about the past. Along with preventing the archives from adding to the nation..È collection, cuts have manifested themselves in reduced hours, slower service, lack of access to important documents, and slashing of staff. The ones who still have their jobs often seem overwhelmed and overworked.
In May 2012, more than 200 people, many of them experts with unique skills and years of experience, lost their jobs. People who arranged for loans of material in the collection, specialists who preserved microfilm, digital experts and reference librarians were tossed out. Training was cut. Half the LAC circulation staff who dealt with analog material ... what the rest of us call books and documents ... were fired. The library also killed its interlibrary loan program. In its last year in the interlibrary loan system, the national library lent 20,000 books to people across the country, often in isolated communities.
Morale among the surviving staff, which was never very good, has tanked. Rather than deal with the lousy work environment, Daniel Caron, the former head of Library and Archives Canada, simply gagged his employees. He was trained as an economist, not a librarian or archivist, and his tenure saw a rapid deterioration in services and morale. Like other managers in the Harper government, Caron wanted to put the screws to employees who might gripe to the public.
Caron and his management team came up with a code of conduct banning librarians and archivists from setting foot in classrooms, attending conferences and speaking at public meetings, whether on the institution..È time or their own. The 23 pages of rules, called ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct: Values and Ethics,.. came into effect in January 2013. Employees could get special dispensation from their bosses, but the fine print of the gag order made it unlikely that permission would be granted. The rules called public speaking, whether to university students, genealogy groups, historians and even other archivists and librarians, ...high risk.. activities that could create conflicts of interest or ...other risks to LAC... The code stressed federal employees..È...duty of loyalty.. not to history or to Library and Archives Canada, but rather to the ...duly elected government... Employees breaking the code could find themselves reported to LAC managers by colleagues who turned them in on what James Turk, executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, called a ...snitch line...
...As public servants, our duty of loyalty to the Government of Canada and its elected officials extends beyond our workplace to our personal activities,.. the code said. It reminded librarians and archivists, many of whom do not consider themselves public menaces, that they must maintain awareness of their surroundings, their audience and how their words or actions could be interpreted (or misinterpreted). They were warned not to fall into the trap of social media. And LAC employees were warned that teaching a class or speaking at a conference put them at special risk, since ...such activities have been identified as high risk to Library and Archives Canada and to the employee with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty...
In March 2013, Harper..È hometown paper, the Calgary Herald, editorialized: ...The code appears overly concerned with what an employee might say about the federal government. Speaking at a conference about the role of archivists, for example, cannot by anyone..È wildest imagination be construed as disloyal. This unwarranted dictate severely limiting the librarians..Èand archivists..Èfreedom of speech is intolerable and must be reversed...
Caron was one person who was allowed to speak out. ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct for its employees is wholly consistent with the values of the Public Service of Canada,.. he wrote in a letter to the editor of the Ottawa Citizen. ...Library and Archives Canada..È Code of Conduct does not prevent Library and Archives employees from engaging in external activities. However, for all public servants, the right to freedom of expression must be balanced with their responsibility to remain impartial and effective in their professional duties. This is commonly applied in the private and public sector...
That chattiness came to an abrupt end in May 2013, after Caron was called into Heritage Minister James Moore..È office to explain why Library and Archives Canada..È leader billed the government nearly $4,500 for Spanish lessons. Soon afterwards, the New Democrats released a document outlining what the party..È heritage critic, Pierre Nantel, called Caron..È ...titanic expenses... The publicly available figures show Caron filed $87,000 in expense claims in each of 2011 and 2012. Moore..È own expenses were about $46,000 in each of those years. Caron submitted expenses for business lunches in Ottawa..È best restaurants and the private Rideau Club, and for rooms in expensive hotels in Quebec City and Puerto Rico, along with trips to Toronto, Europe and Australia. Suddenly, Caron was out of a job.
Just a month after Caron left, the archives finally opened its wallet to buy some Canadiana. It was obvious Library and Archives Canada had learned a lesson on how to serve its masters in the Prime Minister..È Office. Library and Archives Canada chipped in with the Canadian Museum of Civilization (now the Canadian Museum of History) to spend almost $700,000 on a collection of documents and artifacts belonging to Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. It fit with the War of 1812 fetish. The collection was described as ...the largest and most complete collection of War of 1812 documentation ever.. in the government..È announcement, which was made by Heritage Minister Moore.
Library and Archives Canada would carry on, at least for War of 1812 buffs, but its staff would continue to tread very, very carefully.

89,0,"Canadian physicist Arthur B. McDonald has won the Nobel Prize for discoveries about the behaviour of a mysterious solar particle, teased from an experiment buried two kilometres below Sudbury.
The Queen..È University professor emeritus was honoured for co-discovering that elusive particles known as neutrinos can change their identity ... or ...oscillate.. ... as they travel from the sun. It proved that neutrinos must have mass, a finding that upset the Standard Model of particle physics and opened new avenues for research into the fundamental properties of the universe.
McDonald, 72, shares the prize with Takaaki Kajita, whose Japanese collaboration made the same discovery with slightly different methods.
To measure solar neutrinos, McDonald and a 130-person international team built a massive detector in an operational copper mine southwest of Sudbury. The location allowed the experiment to be highly sensitive but created enormous logistical challenges. Construction on the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory ... SNO ... began in 1990. The experiment collected its first data nine years later.
...I think we all knew that if we could manage to do it, it would be a very significant measurement. And that..È the way it turned out,.. McDonald said Tuesday, 10 ...crazy.. hours after he was awakened by a telephone call from Sweden telling him he had won the prize in physics.
SNO has since expanded to become SNOLAB, with more particle experiments underway.
...What we..Èe really pleased about is that we are able to do experiments that can give Canadians and our international collaborators, particularly the young people, a real eureka moment...

The SNO detector solved a long-standing mystery in physics: the case of the missing neutrinos. Theoretical models indicated there should be far more neutrinos streaming from the sun than earthly instruments were detecting. Either we didn..È understand the sun, or we didn..È understand neutrinos ... highly abundant but very elusive subatomic particles that barely interact with matter, and were thought to have no mass.
To solve this problem, McDonald and his colleagues dreamt up SNO. Deep in an INCO mine (now owned by Vale), protected from cosmic radiation constantly bombarding the earth..È surface, the scientists installed a 12-metre-wide acrylic vessel filled with 1,000 tonnes of ultra-pure heavy water. The vessel was surrounded by a geodesic sphere equipped with 9,456 light sensors. The whole thing was sunk in a 34-metre-high cavity filled with regular water.
When neutrinos hit the heavy water, an event that occurred about 10 times a day, they emitted a flash of light, which researchers could analyze to measure the particles..Èproperties.
Neutrinos come in three identities or ...flavours..: electron, tau and muon. By 2001, SNO showed that neutrinos were switching flavours in transit. To do so, they must have mass.
Once all three flavours were measured, the sun..È neutrinos were properly accounted for. The discovery spun out generations of new science ... better understanding neutrinos might solve the riddle of why the universe is dominated by matter instead of being empty, for one.
...Art McDonald is an extraordinary scientist and scientific leader,.. said Pekka Sinervo, a University of Toronto particle physicist who helped provide oversight for SNO in its early days and currently chairs SNOLAB..È board of directors. ...He kept the collaboration moving forward, even in dark days where nothing seemed to be going right (and there were some of those)...
The discovery ...took quite a bit of ingenuity and investment in major experimental science facilities,.. said physics and astronomy professor Ray Jayawardhana, York University..È dean of science and author of the book Neutrino Hunters.
Building SNO cost $73 million, not including the value of the heavy water, which would have rung in at $200 million if it hadn..È been ...loaned.. by AECL, Canada..È federal nuclear agency.
...It is certainly not cheap. But the investment paid off . . . here we are 15 years later being recognized for that wonderful finding,.. said Jayawardhana.

McDonald grew up in Nova Scotia and earned two physics degrees from Dalhousie University. He credits his parents, his high school math teacher in Sydney, N.S., and Dalhousie professors as early inspirations. He began his career at Ontario..È Chalk River nuclear research labs before moving to Princeton in 1982.
He came back to Canada in 1989 to direct SNO and take up a professorship at Queen..È, where he has been ever since. He is still involved in research at SNOLAB, which is investigating dark matter as well as neutrino science.
...We..Èe very fortunate in Canada to have this opportunity with SNOLAB,.. McDonald said. ...It..È just marvellous to be able to stimulate the next generation of students with experiments just as cutting edge as what we were doing with SNO 20 years ago...
Prime Minister Stephen Harper congratulated the professor in a statement.
...Dr. McDonald..È award solidifies Canada..È reputation of having some of the best and brightest scientists and many of the most respected universities and research facilities in the world,.. he said.
...I am certain that Dr. McDonald..È extraordinary accomplishment will further inspire our scientific community and I hope that it will encourage young Canadians who may be considering science as a career choice across the country...
Congratulations poured in from all over, including from the Royal Societies of both Canada and the U.K., where McDonald is a fellow; the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, where McDonald is on the board of directors; and the small but proud Science North, an education centre in Sudbury, where McDonald has an honorary lifetime membership.",,,,,,,,19.4,7.42,3.61,3.81,13.81,11.75,4.23,3.09,5.36,0.72,5.98,5.15,0.21,0.21,0,0,2.89,1,0

In a nod to the anniversary, Film Forum is screening a newly restored version of the movie starting next Friday.

Several of the film..È principals recently talked about their recollections of the production, including Nicholas Pileggi, who adapted the screenplay with Mr. Scorsese from Mr. Pileggi..È nonfiction best seller ...Wiseguy... Here are excerpts from those conversations.

Nicholas Pileggi I was still working at New York magazine when ...Wiseguy.. came out. David Denby was doing reviews. And I got a message at the magazine that Marty Scorsese called.

Ray Liotta (who played Henry Hill): I was on the second floor of the Excelsior Hotel [at the Venice Film Festival]. I looked down, and there was all this commotion and in the middle of it was Marty. He was there with ...The Last Temptation of Christ... I guess he was getting a lot of death threats. I beelined down there. He was surrounded by bodyguards. I started walking toward him. All the bodyguards pushed me off. I just want to say hi to Marty. I think my initial reaction was, ...Get your hands off me,.. acting like a tough guy, which I..È not. He said that..È when he knew.

Paul Sorvino (Paulie): I would have done a ...Dinner is served.. role in a Scorsese picture, that..È how much I wanted to work with him. I met with him and saw immediately he wanted me for the role. I was overjoyed but very worried. I..È done a lot of comedies as well as dramas, but I..È never done a really tough guy. I never had it in me. And this called for a lethality, which I felt was way beyond me. I called my manager three days before we started shooting and said: ...Get me out. I..È going to ruin this great man..È picture, and I..È going to ruin myself... He, being wise, said, ...Call me tomorrow, and if necessary I will get you out...

Then I was going by the hall mirror to adjust my tie. I was just inconsolable. And I looked in the mirror and literally jumped back a foot. I saw a look I..È never seen, something in my eyes that alarmed me. A deadly soulless look in my eyes that scared me and was overwhelmingly threatening. And I looked to the heavens and said, ...You..Èe found it...

Lorraine Bracco (Karen Hill): I had read for him before for [the 1985 comedy] ...After Hours... Marty called me after that audition and said, ...I think you..Èe great ... I..È not going to give you this part, but I know we..Èe going to work together... I hung up and said, ...Yeah, he says that to every actor when they don..È get a part... I was proven very wrong.

Liotta Nick gave me all the cassettes that he had of Henry talking, and I listened to them all the time. I would put the cassette in the car and listen. The most annoying part of it was [Hill..È] constantly eating potato chips through the whole thing. He didn..È care if it bothered Nick. I was listening for hours to this [guy] chomping potato chips. Of him casually telling Nick, ...Oh yeah, that..È when Tommy whacked so and so... It was disgusting. Horrible.

Pileggi I went to the set for a little bit, then I got bored. There was nothing for me to do. You know what kills me? It takes forever to change lighting. Twenty minutes, a half-hour, 45 minutes. I don..È know where Marty gets the patience.

Bracco [On the scene in which Karen pins Henry on the floor and points a gun at him, which was her most difficult.] Basically I had to straddle Mike Ballhaus, who was our director of photography, and not Ray. And Marty had Ray and I, basically we kind of had to talk into the camera. We could see the reflection of ourselves in the camera, and that was weird. Marty told us it was going to be hard. He begged us to take our time.

Liotta The whole thing was tempered by my mom, who was sick and had cancer and died in the middle of it. I was going home every weekend to New Jersey. Then one day I got a specific ...You need to get home... Marty told me, and my knees buckled. I finished the scene, went home, buried her and was back to work three, four days later. And the first scene after the funeral was after I stand Karen up and she says, ...Who do you think you are, Frankie Valli?.. And I..È kind of laughing. That..È one of the great things about acting. Between action and cut, you can really lose yourself and do what needs to be done.

Pileggi You know that scene where Mrs. Scorsese [the director..È mother, who plays the mother of a gangster] is talking about how she..È taken up painting? My mother was taking up painting. One of the pictures my mother did was this guy in a boat with one dog looking one way, the other looking the other. So my mother..È picture ends up in movie. The last credit in the movie is ...Painting by Susan Pileggi... She referred to the movie until she died as ...my movie...

Sorvino After production, I felt guilty about it for about six months. My image of myself is artist, painter, poet, sculptor, thinker, author. What am I really? Am I a killer? It bothered me. It unsettled me. Then I came to the conclusion, I rationalized, if this isn..È in all of us, how does the military of any country inculcate a killing drive into soldiers, to go confront people [toward] which they have no natural animus and kill them? I was in the Army, I know it..È possible. They dig that out of you. That..È how I got out of it.

Pileggi I loved it as a movie, I was delighted. I was sad to hear from [Irwin Winkler, the producer] that at a screening in Southern California ... well, the number varies. Irwin thinks it was 31 who walked out. Marty said 71. I guess it was violent. More than the violence, it was the language, I think it put people off. It was very disappointing. Then the movie reviews came in, which were phenomenal, and it slowly began to build.

Bracco I can..È go somewhere without someone screaming, ...Karen!.. Twenty-five years later people still yell, ...Karen!..

Sorvino I get a lot of ...Hey, Paulie!.. every day. It..È a little rankling. I didn..È want that to be my legacy. Later on, I made my peace with it. I..È tremendously proud that I was part of it.",,,,,,,,11.93,18.51,12.46,5.98,12.9,18.15,5.47,3.86,4.15,3.21,7.8,5.69,0.36,0.15,0.66,0.22,3.43,0,0

94,0,"He was not above seducing a young model by showing interest in her father..È cancer. He promised other women his mentorship and career advice before pushing them for sex acts. And he tried to use financial sleight of hand to keep his wife from finding out about his serial philandering.

Bill Cosby admitted to all of this and more over four days of intense questioning 10 years ago at a Philadelphia hotel, where he defended himself in a deposition for a lawsuit filed by a young woman who accused him of drugging and molesting her.

Even as Mr. Cosby denied he was a sexual predator who assaulted many women, he presented himself in the deposition as an unapologetic, cavalier playboy, someone who used a combination of fame, apparent concern and powerful sedatives in a calculated pursuit of young women ... a profile at odds with the popular image he so long enjoyed, that of father figure and public moralist.

In the deposition, which Mr. Cosby has for years managed to keep private but was obtained by The New York Times, the entertainer comes across as alternately annoyed, mocking, occasionally charming and sometimes boastful, often blithely describing sexual encounters in graphic detail.

He talked of the 19-year-old aspiring model who sent him her poem and ended up on his sofa, where, Mr. Cosby said, she pleasured him with lotion.

He spoke with casual disregard about ending a relationship with another model so he could pursue other women. ...Moving on,.. was his phrase.

He suggested he was skilled in picking up the nonverbal cues that signal a woman..È consent.

...I think I..È a pretty decent reader of people and their emotions in these romantic sexual things, whatever you want to call them,.. he said.

Through it all, his manner was largely one of casual indifference.

At one point in the first day of questioning, Dolores M. Troiani, the lawyer for the plaintiff in the case, Andrea Constand, a young woman who worked at Temple University as a basketball manager, seemed struck by Mr. Cosby..È jocular manner.

...I think you..Èe making light of a very serious situation,.. she said, to which Mr. Cosby replied: ...That may very well be...

Interest in Mr. Cosby..È deposition grew this month when a federal judge unsealed a 62-page memorandum of law in the case, which had been settled in 2006. The memorandum contained excerpts from the deposition, including Mr. Cosby..È acknowledgment that he had obtained quaaludes as part of his effort to have sex with women.

The parties have been prohibited from releasing the memorandum because of a confidentiality clause that was part of the settlement agreement, but the deposition itself was never sealed. This month, Ms. Constand..È lawyer asked the court to lift the confidentiality clause so her client would be free to release the nearly 1,000-page deposition transcript. The Times later learned that the transcript was already publicly available through a court reporting service.

Mr. Cosby has never been charged with a crime and has repeatedly denied the accusations of sexual assault, now leveled by dozens of women. David Brokaw, Mr. Cosby..È publicist, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. Ms. Troiani declined to comment. In three suits, women who accused Mr. Cosby of sexual misconduct are pursuing civil claims against him. In addition, the Los Angeles police have said they are reviewing a complaint of a sexual nature against Mr. Cosby.

While Mr. Cosby described encounters with many women through the course of his deposition, it is through his long and detailed descriptions of his relationship with Ms. Constand, who is much younger, that Mr. Cosby..È attitudes, proclivities and approach to women are most clearly revealed. Ms. Constand was present for at least some of Mr. Cosby..È testimony in the Rittenhouse Hotel in Philadelphia.

First spotting her at Temple University in the early 2000s, Mr. Cosby said he felt romantic interest immediately (...She..È good-looking..), and began a relationship that led, in his telling, to dinners and more.

Asked how he wooed her, Mr. Cosby, who has been married since 1964, responded: ...Inviting her to my house, talking to her about personal situations dealing with her life, growth, education...

He painted his relationship with Ms. Constand as one of mentor and mentee, casting himself in the role of an experienced guide and offering her the benefit of his contacts, fame and experience.

At times he described becoming frustrated after Ms. Constand failed to follow his advice, such as when he wanted her to pursue her interest in sports broadcasting by calling someone and she did not. ...Here..È a mentor, Bill Cosby, who is in the business, Bill Cosby, who happens to know something about what to do and Andrea is not picking up on it,.. he said.

Ms. Constand ultimately went to the police to complain of Mr. Cosby..È behavior, but in his telling, his seduction was one of persistence and patience.

Early on in his courtship, he arranged an intimate meal alone with her at his Pennsylvania home, complete with Cognac, dimmed lights and a fire, he said. At one point he led her to his back porch, out of sight from his chef. ...I take her hair and I pull it back and I have her face like this,.. he said. ...And I..È talking to her ...And I talked to her about relaxing, being strong. And I said to her, come in, meaning her body...

But the two remained inches apart, he said, and he did not try to kiss her because he did not sense she wanted him to. Nevertheless, at the next dinner he said they had what he described as a ...sexual moment,.. short of intercourse. He described her afterward as having ...a glow...

Expounding on his philosophy about sex, Mr. Cosby said he tended to refrain from intercourse because he did not want women to fall in love with him. To him, he said, the act of sexual intercourse ...is something that I feel the woman will succumb to more of a romance and more of a feeling, not love, but it..È deeper than a playful situation... As far as he and Ms. Constand went, he said, they were ...playing sex, we..Èe playing, petting, we..Èe playing...

Was he in love with her? ...No...

Yet the association endured for a few years, until one night at his Pennsylvania home, when Ms. Constand said Mr. Cosby drugged and molested her.

Mr. Cosby said he gave her one and a half tablets of Benadryl to relieve stress, they kissed and had sexual contact. Her lawyer said she believed it was a much more powerful drug.

Some time later, after Ms. Constand had moved home to Canada, Mr. Cosby spoke with Ms. Constand..È mother on the telephone. The mother, he said, was upset about what her daughter said Mr. Cosby had done, describing the experience as ...a mother..È nightmare...

In the deposition, he said he was worried that Ms. Constand..È mother would think of him as a ...dirty old man...

During the call, Mr. Cosby told the deposing lawyers, he wanted Ms. Constand to tell her mother ...about the orgasm.. so that she would realize it was consensual.

...Tell your mother about the orgasm. Tell your mother how we talked,.. he said he remembered thinking.

Subsequently, concerned that Ms. Constand and her mother might seek to embarrass him, he said he offered to help pay for Ms. Constand..È further education. Years earlier, he offered to reward another woman, Therese Serignese, whom he had met at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1976, with money as a bonus for good grades.

It is difficult to say to what extent Mr. Cosby..È wife, Camille, was aware of her husband..È womanizing, though it was certainly clear to her by 1997, when Mr. Cosby acknowledged an affair. Mrs. Cosby suggested at the time that there had been marital problems but they had put them behind them.

Still, in the deposition, Mr. Cosby, 78, described going to some lengths to hide his behavior, blocking a magazine article to avoid publicity and funneling money to one woman through his agent so ...Mrs. Cosby.. wouldn..È find out.

In the case of Ms. Constand, who never sought any funds, Mr. Cosby said he imagined his wife would have known he was helping with her education. But, he said, ...My wife would not know it was because Andrea and I had had sex and that Andrea was now very, very upset and that she decided that she would like to go to school...

While Mr. Cosby insisted the only drug he had given Ms. Constand was Benadryl, he was open about his access in the 1970s to quaaludes, a sedative also popular as a party drug.

He said he obtained seven prescriptions for them over two to three years from a doctor in Los Angeles, ostensibly for a sore back but in reality to give to women.

He admitted to giving young women quaaludes at that time ...the same as a person would say have a drink,.. he said, but not without their knowledge.

Though he portrayed the drug-taking and sex as consensual, Mr. Cosby ... when asked whether Ms. Serignese was in a position to consent to sexual intercourse after he gave her quaaludes in 1976 ... said: ...I don..È know...

Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for Ms. Serignese and two other women who are suing Mr. Cosby for defamation, said of the deposition: ...This information is important because it sheds light on the private practices of a man who holds himself out as a public moralist...

During the questioning, Mr. Cosby cast himself as a sensitive and attentive supporter of Ms. Constand, though his tone changed when addressing Ms. Constand in the present tense.

Asked by Ms. Constand..È lawyer about how he felt when Ms. Constand cried during her own deposition, Mr. Cosby was unsparing: ...I think Andrea is a liar and I know she..È a liar because I was there. I was there...

And he could be dispassionate in recalling former relationships. With a woman named Beth Ferrier, a model he met in the 1980s, he recalled inquiring after her career and her father, who had died of cancer.

...Did you ask her those questions because you wanted to have sexual contact with her?.. Ms. Troiani asked.

...Yes,.. Mr. Cosby responded.

Still, he said he viewed himself as a good person, worthy of trust, and chivalrous in his desire to never tell others about the women with whom he had sex.

...I am a man, the only way you will hear about who I had sex with is from the person I had it with,.. he said.

In some passages, Mr. Cosby offered a glimpse into a life long insulated by perks and wealth. Some idiosyncrasies are revealed, like his penchant for sweatpants (he had at least 100, he said), how he used the name Seymour Rapaport as an alias in the 1970s and 1980s when he traveled, and how many of his employees signed confidentiality agreements.

In the deposition, Mr. Cosby described sexual liaisons ... he sometimes calls them rendezvous ... with at least five women, and having a ...romantic.. interest in two more, in locations like Denver, Las Vegas and New York and Pennsylvania, in hotels or in one of his homes.

In the court case, 13 women came forward with anonymous sworn statements to support Ms. Constand, saying that they, too, had been molested in some way by Mr. Cosby. But they never had a chance to pursue their claims in court because, six months after the fourth and final day of his deposition, Mr. Cosby settled the case with Ms. Constand on undisclosed terms. His deposition was filed away, another document in a settled court case, until now",,,,,,,,23.67,14.71,10.89,3.82,15.62,13.94,6.06,3.72,3.92,1.37,7.53,7.74,0.25,0,0.1,0,2.85,0,0

96,0,"PHILADELPHIA...Bill Cosby admitted in 2005 that he got Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave the sedative to at least one woman and ...other people,.. according to documents obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
That woman and a second woman testified in the same case that they knowingly took Quaaludes from him, according to the unsealed documents.
Cosby..È admission could bolster defamation claims by his accusers, the women..È lawyers said.
...If today..È report is true, Mr. Cosby admitted under oath 10 years ago sedating women for sexual purposes,.. said Lisa Bloom, attorney for model Janice Dickinson, who contends she was drugged and raped. ...Given that, how dare he publicly vilify Ms. Dickinson and accuse her of lying when she tells a very similar story?..
The AP had gone to court to compel the release of the documents from the deposition in a sexual abuse lawsuit filed by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand, the first of a cascade of sexual abuse lawsuits against him.

Bill Cosby admitted in a 2005 deposition that he obtained Quaaludes with the intent of using them to have sex with young women.

2 former models the latest to accuse Cosby of drugging them
Cosby settled that lawsuit under confidential terms in 2006. His lawyers in the Philadelphia case did not immediately return phone calls Monday. Constand consented to be identified but did not want to comment, her lawyer said Monday.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than two dozen women of sexual misconduct, including allegations by many that he drugged and raped them in incidents dating back more than four decades. Cosby has never been criminally charged, and most of the accusations are barred by statutes of limitations.
Cosby, giving sworn testimony in the lawsuit accusing him of sexual assaulting Constand in his home in Pennsylvania in 2005, said he acquired seven Quaalude prescriptions in the 1970s. The lawyer for Constand asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s ... after they were banned ... but was frustrated by objections from Cosby..È lawyer.
...When you got the Quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these Quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?.. lawyer Dolores Troiani asked.
...Yes,.. Cosby answered on Sept. 29, 2005.
...Did you ever give any of these young women the Quaaludes without their knowledge?..
Cosby..È lawyer again objected, leading Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to co-operate.

This excerpt from a 2005 deposition given by entertainer Bill Cosby shows the entertainer admitting that he obtained Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with.

Cosby later said he gave Constand three half-pills of Benadryl, although in the documents Troiani voices doubt that that was the drug involved. The two other women who testified on Constand..È behalf said they knowingly took Quaaludes from Cosby.
Three of the women accusing Cosby of sexually assaulting them have a defamation lawsuit pending against him in Massachusetts. They allege that he defamed them when his agents said their accusations were untrue. Cosby is trying to get their case thrown out before discovery.
Cosby had fought the AP..È efforts to unseal the testimony, with his lawyer arguing the deposition could reveal details of Cosby..È marriage, sex life and prescription drug use.
...It would be terribly embarrassing for this material to come out,.. lawyer George Gowen argued in June. He said the public should not have access to what Cosby was forced to say as he answered questions under oath from the accuser..È lawyer nearly a decade ago.
...Frankly . . . it would embarrass him, (and) it would also prejudice him in the eyes of the jury pool in Massachusetts,.. Gowen said.
U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno asked last month why Cosby was fighting the release of his sworn testimony, given that the accusations in the Temple woman..È lawsuit were already in the public eye.
...Why would he be embarrassed by his own version of the facts?.. Robreno said.

101,0,"SHANGHAI ... Share prices in China plunged on Friday in one of the sharpest sell-offs in years, accelerating a downturn this last week in what has been, for much of this year, the world..È best-performing stock market.

China..È two major market indexes fell in tandem. The Shanghai composite fell 7.4 percent on Friday. The Shenzhen composite fell even more, dropping 7.9 percent. Share prices in Hong Kong, which is regulated separately, also fell, by 1.8 percent.

Analysts had been warning for months about the risks of a stock market bubble in China, where giddy investors have driven up stock prices by purchasing shares on margin, or with money borrowed from brokers.

China..È market has been an anomaly. Even though the broader Chinese economy has been relatively weak, share prices of many Chinese-listed companies have skyrocketed in the last year. Many traded at record valuations, often 80, 90 or 100 times their projected earnings.

The high valuations have been a boon for listed companies and their major shareholders. The market boom has also helped encourage a wave of Chinese companies that had listed in the United States to arrange stock buyouts and delist with the intention of eventually relisting in China, where stock valuations are much higher.

In the last few months, some well-known Chinese companies have announced plans to buy back shares and delist from the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, including Wuxi Pharma Tech, HomeInn Hotels and Qihoo 360, the Internet services provider, whose management offered $9 billion in a buyout.

But China..È roaring stock market showed in the week just past how volatile prices can be: Shenzhen..È main index fell the previous week, then rose early last week, then tumbled again.

Authorities are moving to tighten rules on buying stock with borrowed money, which is believed to be one of the key drivers of a stock market rally that has sent share prices to seven-year highs.

The regulators are also trying to crack down on financing from unregulated sources, what analysts refer to as over-the-counter stock margin financing.

...This is what triggered the correction,.. said Steven Sun, a Hong Kong-based analyst for HSBC. ...Also, there have been controlling shareholders, significant shareholders and corporate management trying to cash out. They had been selling massively into the rally. And these are people in a better position to know the performance of their company...

Many analysts say that the government props up the stock market as a policy move aimed at helping debt-burdened state-owned companies repair their balance sheets. A strong market also improves the financing of private entrepreneurs, which could help spur innovation.

But the government has been careful to warn about some of the risks, including the use of borrowed money, knowing that a sharp decline could hurt smaller investors.

Analysts at some major banks, including HSBC and Morgan Stanley, have been cautioning investors about the risks of the market, particularly after a big sell-off last month. Although stock prices are still up significantly from a year ago, with the Shanghai composite reaching 5,166.35, up as much as 160 percent in the last two years, there are signs that some of the most sought-after stocks are now in the doldrums.

The Shanghai composite is down about 18 percent from its June high. But in Shenzhen, the so-called ChiNext, a kind of Nasdaq-style board on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange for growth stocks, has dropped about 30 percent in the last several weeks, meaning it is already technically in a bear market.

The FTSE in London fell nearly 0.8 percent on Friday; while the German DAX closed up 0.2 percent and the CAC in France rose 0.4 percent. United States indexes were mixed: The Standard & Poor..È 500-stock index was flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and Nasdaq fell 0.6 percent.

Chi Lo, a senior economist covering greater China for BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said the Chinese government had promoted the growth of the stock market as a tool for financial reform, like reducing the economy..È reliance on bank lending. But he said the government grew concerned about margin lending, and that, combined with a steady stream of new companies listing their shares on the market, had led to a correction in prices.

102,0,"Wall Street..È self-regulator plans to take a closer look at electronic trading in bonds this year, as part of an expanded review of fixed-income markets.

The regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, announced the initiative on Tuesday in a letter outlining its priorities for 2015. Among the plans, Finra said it would start conducting examinations of firms that offer electronic bond trading, as well as ...books and records, supervision and order execution practices.. in bonds.

Richard G. Ketchum, Finra..È chief executive, said the review was motivated by broad changes in the bond market. Partly in response to new regulations, bond dealers are holding less inventory, pushing more trading to various intermediaries, he said.

...I do think this is very much a year of fixed-income,.. Mr. Ketchum said in an interview. ...Sales practices and best execution in fixed-income are going to be a huge focus...

In its review of bond trading, Finra said it would scrutinize whether firms are able to ensure they are achieving the best price for their customers. The regulator also said it was examining situations where bond intermediaries may have failed to disclose information about how they are charging customers.

When the regulator announced its priorities last year, it said it would seek to increase the visibility of its BrokerCheck website, which lets investors see whether a broker has a clean record.

103,0,"Cutting the financial cord with adult children can be hard to do.

Just ask Virginia Illiano, a substitute teacher who lives in Brooklyn. After her daughter graduated from an expensive private college, Ms. Illiano thought her days of paying big bills for her daughter were over.

She was wrong. Her daughter, who is in her 20s, was not able to find a good-paying job and ended up moving in with her mother. That was just the beginning. Ms. Illiano co-signed for a leased car, repaid some of her daughter..È credit card debt and even paid for her nails, vacations and some clothes.

...My teacher benefits are awesome, but she won..È have any of that,.. said Ms. Illiano, 55, who is divorced. And that..È just fine with Ms. Illiano.

...I told my daughter to go for her dream,.. she said, explaining that she wanted her ...to have her financial legs...

Ms. Illiano..È financial leg up for her daughter, however, has a downside. She is dipping into her own retirement funds, which means she is now looking at a couple of difficult choices: working longer or selling her home, which is already being used as collateral for her daughter..È student loan.

More older parents are facing challenges like Ms. Illiano..È. They are helping their adult children by dishing out loans or cash gifts, or paying bills. But this largess sometimes blows a big hole in their finances, even jeopardizing their retirement. As a result, some older adults are going back to work, reducing their own living expenses or even declaring bankruptcy.

While rigorous data is difficult to obtain, several reports suggest that the problems associated with supporting adult children are growing. At the same time, many baby boomers are far short of holding enough in their retirement accounts to support themselves into old age.

...Some adult children aren..È making enough money,.. said Netiva Heard, a certified debt counselor at MNH Credit Solutions in Chicago. ...So parents are taking over certain bills like credit cards, cellphones and rent...

Parents, of course, want the best for their children from the moment they are born and are used to doing everything they can to help them. Continuing that support into adulthood has spread, experts say, largely because the economy of the last decade has fallen short in generating good job opportunities for their millennial children.

...But the last thing you want is for your kids to end up taking care of you financially,.. Ms. Heard said. ...And, anyway, kids can learn from their own money struggles...

Baby boomers face increasing retirement challenges of their own as traditional defined benefit pensions have been widely replaced by riskier 401(k) plans and the like, which require disciplined savings. Many have not done the comprehensive financial planning needed to factor in the greater chance that they will live longer, or accumulated enough in savings and investments to cover future health expenses.

...So they..Èe not looking at the long-term effects of shelling out $5,000 or so per year to adult kids,.. said Jamie Hopkins, associate professor of taxation at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa. ...That money could be funding an I.R.A. contribution...

There are clear warning signs, experts said, that parents may be giving their adult children too much money. These include taking loans from 401(k) accounts, failing to make full retirement account contributions or draining savings.

Take Jacquelyn McClellan, 74, who lives in Orange City, Fla. In what admittedly is an extreme case, Ms. McClellan, a retired program analyst for the federal government, began paying for various expenses for her grandchildren after her son said he could not afford them. She paid for dancing school, parochial school, trips to Disneyland, all with the help of money from her pension.

These payments ended up tipping Ms. McClellan into bankruptcy in 2011. Since then, Ms. McClellan has sharply dialed back her own lifestyle. She can..È go on vacation cruises and has only minimal savings.

Still, Ms. McClellan felt a sense of duty to help out her grandchildren. ...I didn..È want them to have a bad life,.. she said, adding that they are now flourishing.

Giving some financial help can be a much-needed balm for family members. The problem is, many parents approaching or already in retirement do not know where they stand financially and how much they can afford to give without undermining their own security.

Giving gifts of money to chronically needy adult children can become expensive very quickly.

To solve a money squeeze, avoid giving away inheritances early, said Eric J. Schaefer, a certified financial planner at Evermay Wealth Management in Arlington, Va. Adult children often only end up coming back for more money, he explained.

Supporting more extravagant expenses like a fancy car or country club memberships should be cut off altogether, Mr. Schaefer recommended.

One-time loans, or gifts, that are used to pay for unexpected emergencies like medical expenses require little thought for parents who can afford them.

But going back to the money trough time and time again is dangerous. ...Look at kids and ask, ...What is the money for?..È. said Robert J. Semrad in Chicago, the senior partner at DebtStoppers, a bankruptcy law firm. ...Is this a solution to the problem or just a Band-Aid? Many times money given as a Band-Aid merely delays the inevitable...

Avoid co-signing loans for cars or homes, Mr. Semrad said, since a parent..È own credit can be jeopardized. ...Banks can go after co-signers,.. he said. ...And having assets makes you more susceptible...

Properly drafted loans by parents to their children can teach the children valuable financial lessons, though. The keys, experts said, are to give the loans set terms and to establish a regular repayment schedule.

Peter Lazaroff, a financial adviser at Plancorp in Missouri, recommends loans that include interest rates. The loan then works just like a bond, he added, and the parent gets back principal and interest. The child should also sign a contract, which can be drafted by a lawyer. A loan that is not paid back can be deducted from an inheritance.

Kathleen Gurney, who runs the Financial Psychology Corporation in Florida, encouraged parents to structure a loan as if a son or daughter were a business partner. The contract should include loan terms, length and consequences for nonpayment.

...Loaning money works well,.. she said, ...if the process is objective and well planned...

Ms. Gurney has seen many cases in which older parents helped their adult children, only to end up in dire financial straits themselves. One couple she counseled had to return to work part time in a restaurant because they had decided to support their divorced son..È wife and children.

...These financial decisions can affect your health and marriage,.. she said. ...And some people even slip into depression because they must continue to work...

Experts also caution against giving a loan to an adult child who clearly cannot repay it. Family loans, they point out, are common, but being paid back is less so.

Instead of cash, parents can offer their children networking help in looking for a job and provide other forms of support. But when gifts or loans are involved, the most important thing is to be honest with yourself ... and your children.

...Tough love,.. said Mr. Hopkins at the American College, ...requires parents to plan what they give their children. So you must have a process in place...",,,,,,,,16.63,9.62,6.58,3.05,12.83,14.6,5.45,3.69,3.69,1.36,7.22,7.3,0.08,0,0.16,0,3.29,0,0

104,0,"Here is something every non-rich American family should know: The odds are that you will run out of money in retirement.

On average, a typical working family in the anteroom of retirement ... headed by somebody 55 to 64 years old ... has only about $104,000 in retirement savings, according to the Federal Reserve..È Survey of Consumer Finances.

That..È not nearly enough. And the situation will only grow worse.

The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College estimates that more than half of all American households will not have enough retirement income to maintain the living standards they were accustomed to before retirement, even if the members of the household work until 65, two years longer than the average retirement age today.


Using a different, more complex model, the Employee Benefit Research Institute calculates that 83 percent of baby boomers and Generation Xers in the bottom fourth of the income distribution will eventually run short of money. Higher up on the income scale, people also face challenges: More than a quarter of those with incomes between the middle of the income distribution and the 75th percentile will probably run short.

The standard prescription is that Americans should put more money aside in investments. The recommendation, however, glosses over a critical driver of unpreparedness: Wall Street is bleeding savers dry.

...Everybody..È big focus is that we have to save more,.. said John C. Bogle, founder and former chief executive of Vanguard, the investment management colossus. ...A greater part of the problem is the failure of investors to earn their fair share of market returns...

His observation suggests a different policy prescription: shoring up Americans..Èretirement requires, first of all, aligning the interests of investment advisers and their clients.

A research paper by Mr. Bogle published in Financial Analysts Journal makes the case. Actively managed mutual funds, in which many workers invest their retirement savings, are enormously costly.

First, there is the expense ratio ... about 1.12 percent of assets for the average large capitalization blend fund. Then there are transaction costs and distribution costs. Active funds also pay a penalty for keeping a share of their assets in low-yielding cash. Altogether, costs add up to 2.27 percent per year, Mr. Bogle estimates.

By contrast, a passive index fund, like Vanguard..È Total Stock Market Index Fund, costs merely 0.06 percent a year in all.

Of course, Mr. Bogle has a horse in the race. He founded the Vanguard Group. He invented the first index fund for the public. His case is powerful, nonetheless.

Assuming an annual market return of 7 percent, he says, a 30-year-old worker who made $30,000 a year and received a 3 percent annual raise could retire at age 70 with $927,000 in the pot by saving 10 percent of her wages every year in a passive index fund. (Such a nest egg, at the standard withdrawal rate of 4 percent, would generate an inflation-adjusted $37,000 a year more or less indefinitely.) If she put it in a typical actively managed fund, she would end up with only $561,000.

We might have seen this building decades ago. As companies gradually did away with the defined-benefit pensions that once provided working families with their main supplement to Social Security, workers found they had to shoulder the responsibility and risk of saving and investing for retirement largely on their own.

In 1979, almost two in five private sector workers had a defined-benefit pension that would pay out a check until they died. Today only 14 percent do. Almost one in three, by contrast, must make do with a retirement savings account alone to supplement their Social Security check.

If there is an industry rived with conflicts of interest, it is the financial conglomerates that advise Americans on investing these savings. Yet nobody was paying attention to the safeguards that might be needed when corporate retirement funds managed by sophisticated professionals were replaced by individual 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts.

...Wall Street makes no money on low-cost index funds,.. said David F. Swensen, who runs the investment portfolio for Yale. ...That is the problem...

It..È not hard to find evidence of Wall Street..È rapaciousness.

Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard and colleagues from M.I.T. and the University of Hamburg sent ...mystery shoppers.. to visit financial advisers. They found that advisers mostly recommended investment strategies that fit their own financial interests. They reinforced their clients..Èmisguided biases, encouraging them to chase returns and advising against low-cost options like low-fee index funds.

Another study, by Susan Christoffersen of the University of Toronto and colleagues from the University of Virginia and the University of Pennsylvania, found that investment advisers directed more of their clients..Èmoney to funds that shared the upfront fees with them. Returns of these funds were poor, compared with alternatives.

...It is superslimy,.. noted Kent Smetters, an expert on finance at the University of Pennsylvania..È Wharton School.

President Obama has tried to take a crack at one corner of the problem: questionable advice provided by managers of I.R.A.s.

For all their flaws, 401(k) plans have a fiduciary responsibility to act in participants..Èbest interest. Many managers of I.R.A.s, by contrast, are not legally bound to put their clients..Èinterests first. They must offer ...suitable.. products ... a much squishier standard.

...They can..È put your grandma in a heavy tech fund,.. Mr. Smetters said. ...But they could put her in a more expensive bond fund that pays them a huge commission...

It should be no surprise which of these Wall Street prefers. In a 2011 report, the Government Accountability Office of Congress said it found advisers who were paid $6,000 to $9,000 if clients rolled over savings from 401(k) plans to I.R.A.s.

I.R.A.s are a huge source of profit for Wall Street. Workers roll some $300 billion worth of 401(k) balances into I.R.A.s when they leave their jobs every year.

The White House..È Council of Economic Advisers argues that ...conflicted advice.. by advisers who get payments from the funds they recommend reduces the annual returns to investment by 1 percentage point, a more modest penalty than Mr. Bogle..È analysis might suggest. Still, this could cost savers up to $33 billion a year out of $3.3 trillion invested by I.R.A.s subject to potentially conflicted advice.

In 2010, the Labor Department proposed imposing fiduciary responsibility on I.R.A. advisers. The resistance from Wall Street was so fierce that the Obama administration was forced to back down. Last month, the administration tried again. Perhaps it will have better luck this time.

Mr. Swensen, Mr. Bogle and Mr. Smetters applaud the Obama administration..È shot at changing the rules. But they acknowledge that imposing tighter standards on I.R.A.s will not end suspect advice. And most investment assets are held outside tax-preferred retirement accounts and would not be subject to the rule change.

Unlike regulations in Canada and some Western European countries, which have essentially banned kickbacks from funds to investment advisers, the Obama administration..È proposed rule does not directly attack conflicts of interest.

But the new rule could move American retirement saving one step closer to the goal: getting almost everybody to stop trying to beat the market, put their money in low-cost index funds and leave it there. Then Americans might reach retirement better prepared.",,,,,,,,18.38,7.76,4,3.76,14.08,9.52,3.12,2.64,4.16,1.28,8.08,4.96,0.48,0,0,0,1.6,0,0

Billed as a starter account to encourage retirement saving, the myRA, or my Retirement Account, program has been adjusted to make participation easier.

Participants may withdraw their contributions tax-free and without a penalty, so the money can be used for emergencies if needed. And the accounts are not tied to a specific employer, so they go with workers who change jobs.

The money is held in a special Roth I.R.A. and invested in United States Treasury savings bonds paying the same variable interest rate as the Government Securities Fund, which is available to federal employees through the government retirement plan. Over the last five years, the fund..È interest rate has averaged 2 percent, Treasury officials said. That is hardly spectacular, but higher than the interest rate on a traditional savings account, they said.

Savers can withdraw their myRA contributions at any time without taxes or penalties. But because the accounts are subject to Roth I.R.A. rules, savers may pay taxes and penalties on the interest earned, if they withdraw their money before age 59Î.

Once a saver has contributed the maximum $15,000, or the account has been open for 30 years, it stops earning interest and must be rolled into a private sector Roth I.R.A. to continue growing.

Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, said the government was not suggesting that $15,000 was an adequate retirement nest egg. But millions of Americans lack any retirement savings, so they need to begin somewhere, he said. Nearly a third of workers say they have no retirement savings or pension, according to a 2015 report from the Federal Reserve.

...The challenge is to get started in the first place,.. Mr. Lew said. Once people get used to saving small amounts, he said, they may become more comfortable saving larger sums to create a thicker retirement cushion.

Nancy Register, national director of the America Saves campaign, called the program a ...terrific.. tool to get lower- and moderate-income consumers accustomed to saving. ...We believe this is a needed product,.. she said.

President Obama first directed the Treasury to establish the myRA program in his January 2014 State of the Union address. Since 2014, the department has worked with a group of 60 employers in a pilot program to develop the account.

Tom Galea, president of Norton..È Flowers & Gifts, a floral shop based in Ypsilanti, Mich., said his company took part in the pilot and found the myRA plan simple to use. Six of his 21 employees participate, with some contributing as little as $5 from their paycheck every two weeks. ...It..È really a savings training program,.. he said.

Here are questions and answers about myRA:

._¾ Who is eligible for myRA?

Participants must have taxable compensation to contribute, and fall within Roth I.R.A. income guidelines. For 2015, a single person can make a maximum of $131,000.

._¾ How do I sign up for myRA?

Go to www.myra.gov and enter the necessary information, including your Social Security number. The website has letters and forms to give to your employer, if you want money deducted from your paycheck. You may contribute earnings from multiple employers to the account.

._¾ Can I fund a myRA account with an income tax refund?

Yes. You can direct all or part of your federal income tax refund into your myRA account.",,,,,,,,18.72,7.43,5.81,1.51,12.89,12.31,5.23,1.74,4.07,0.81,6.97,7.32,0.35,0,0.46,0,1.63,0,0

106,0,"OTTAWA...Jobs will be harder to find and the economy will slow as the oil price crash bites in coming months, the Bank of Canada said as it sought to cushion the blow by unexpectedly lowering its key interest rate.
In a signal that fallout from sliding oil prices could be much worse than expected, the central bank reduced its overnight interest rate to 0.75 per cent from 1 per cent.
The Bank of Canada uses the key rate to influence the borrowing costs commercial banks charge business and consumers, which allows the central bank to boost economic growth if there is a risk of sharp downturn.
...We decided that it was appropriate to take out some insurance against that downside risk in the form of a lower interest rate profile,.. bank governor Stephen Poloz said after the rate announcement.
It likely means lower mortgage costs for homebuyers and a longer grace period ... probably until at least next year ... before mortgage holders are squeezed when the Bank of Canada begins to drive up borrowing costs to head off a burst of inflation.
The bank has not altered its key interest rate since September 2010 and the surprise decision went off like a bomb in financial markets. The prospect of increased business investment and commercial activity from lower rates prompted a sharp rally on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The S&P/TSX composite index jumped 251.98 points to 14,560.42.
But the Canadian dollar plummeted, closing on exchange markets at 81.07 (U.S.) cents, down 1.53 cents from its close on Tuesday.
...The dollar has tanked. There is a run to the U.S. dollar,.. Rahim Madhavji of Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange wrote in a research note.
The oil price slide is hammering the economy, Poloz said. He predicted growth will stumble to a low 1.5 per cent in the first half of this year. For 2015 as a whole, the bank now predicts growth of 2.1 per cent, well below its previous forecast of 2.4 per cent.
While Poloz..È move may help the economy, in the short run it could increase pressure on Prime Minister Stephen Harper..È government to revise its economic approach. The strategy currently hinges on eliminating the federal budget deficit to open the way for $5 billion a year in new spending and tax breaks for families, particularly a controversial plan to allow spouses to split income for tax purposes. Because only about 15 per cent of families would benefit from this $2-billion annual measure, it has been sharply criticized as a waste of valuable financial resources.
Taking into account the new spending announcements by Harper in the fall, falling oil prices put the federal government in danger of running another budget deficit in 2015 instead of meeting its claim that the books will be balanced this year, economists say.
Thrown off course by the oil shock, Finance Minister Joe Oliver took the rare step last week of announcing the 2015 budget announcement will be put off from the usual February-March time slot until April at the earliest.
...This rate cut shows that the Bank of Canada believes the Canadian economy is facing more trouble than the Conservatives are admitting,.. NDP finance critic Nathan Cullen said. Oliver..È economic plan is ...in the shredder.. and it..È time the Harper government abandoned its obsession with a balanced budget and tax cuts and instead bring out an economic stimulus plan, he said.
...We need to make sure that the government..È priority is focused on creating growth and jobs for the middle class,.. Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau told reporters. ...Right now (the Conservatives..È priority is on continuing to promise a $2-billion tax break for the wealthier Canadians,.. he said in reference to Harper..È income-splitting proposal. ...That..È simply not responsible...
Canadian Labour Congress economist Angella MacEwan said Poloz appears to have felt he had to move to stimulate the economy because Oliver had no plan to do so.
...The bank was listening to what the federal government was saying in response to what the bank saw as a huge impact on the Canadian economy and felt that they (the central bank) had to step in and take some action,.. she told the Star.
The bank noted lower petroleum costs will have a different impact in different sections of the country.
...While the net impact of lower oil prices on the Canadian economy is negative, the effects across regions and sectors are expected to vary significantly,.. the bank said. Business activity in oil-producing regions will suffer, it added.
...In contrast, the manufacturing sector will benefit from stronger demand in the United States, lower shipping costs and the weaker Canadian dollar,.. the bank said in its quarterly forecast. Economists have said the Ontario economy should pick up as a result of the oil price shift.
...Growth in Ontario looks okay,.. TD Bank economist Derek Burleton told CBC-TV. ...This is an insurance move against uncertainty in the economy.. by Poloz, he said.
Poloz acknowledged lower borrowing costs may worsen Canada..È record-level of household debt. But he said the need to stabilize the economy in the long run outweighed the risk of financial stability in the household sector.
Oliver said he doesn..È comment on Bank of Canada decisions but added in a statement: ...As we..Èe always said, Canada is not immune to the economic challenges and decisions made beyond our borders. That is why our government continues our focus on jobs and economic growth. Our plan is working with one of the strongest job and growth records in the G7 group of countries...
Poloz said the Canadian economy had been showing signs of growth before oil prices dived.
...Outside the energy sector, we are beginning to see the anticipated sequence of increased foreign demand, stronger exports, improved business confidence and investment and employment growth,.. he said.
He added, ...The negative impact of lower oil prices will gradually be mitigated by a stronger U.S. economy, a weaker Canadian dollar, and the bank..È monetary policy response...",,,,,,,,24.44,5.29,1.9,3.39,15.07,12.67,3.89,1.6,4.39,2.69,4.69,3.79,0.1,0,0,0,2.99,1,0

The European rout worsened, with equities tumbling for a fourth day and Germany..È benchmark gauge heading for a bear market.

Bangkok's stock market plunged Monday after fears over China's economy sent world share markets tumbling.

...Today everyone seems to be selling off, and there..È panic, there..È no rational choice anymore, no rational reaction,.. according to Michael Woischneck of Lampe Asset Management GmbH. ...There wont be a rebound today. The Americans will add to the European selling pressure in the afternoon, and that may drive us even lower...
The DAX, one of the biggest gainers at the start of the year, will be among the most hit due its exposure to China, Woischneck said. If it closes at the current level, it will be the first to enter a bear market among western-European gauges.
All of the region..È national stock measures fell more than 2.5 per cent. The U.K...È FTSE 100 Index is heading for its lowest level since 2012 and briefly dropped below 6,000. Glencore Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. tumbled more than 6 per cent.

Abengoa SA was among the only Stoxx 600 companies rising. A report said one of its shareholders repaid a loan and the shares used as collateral were freed. Modern Times Group AB gained 2.6 per cent after the Swedish media firm said it will cut jobs.
More than $5 trillion have already been wiped out from the value of global stocks since China unexpectedly devalued the yuan, raising concern over a global economic slowdown. The panic intensified at the end of last week, when U.S. equities, which had remained relatively stable, tumbled as investors dumped the biggest winners of 2015.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.5 per cent to close at 3,209.91 points, its biggest one-day loss since an 8.8 per cent decline on Feb. 27, 2007. The index is down 38 per cent from its June 12 peak and just under 1 per cent below its closing on Dec. 31, last year..È final trading day.
The slump has inflicted heavy losses on small investors, souring many on stock ownership and threatening to disrupt Communist Party plans to use the market to raise money for reforms of state industry.
...It feels like the end of the world,.. said Pan Chong, a social media specialist. He said he invested 50,000 yuan ($10,350) in April, made 40 per cent and then saw the market wipe out those gains.
...The so-called correction will finally become a long-term bear market,.. said Pan, 25. ...So I..È considering selling all my shares as soon as possible...
The Chinese benchmark soared more than 150 per cent starting in late 2014 after state media said shares were inexpensive, which led investors to believe Beijing would shore up prices if needed. Urged on by state media, millions of novice investors rushed into the market.
Prices faltered and then plunged after an unrelated change in banking regulations in June led investors to question whether Beijing..È support might be weakening. The market index fell 30 per cent, prompting Beijing to intervene by barring big shareholders from selling and promising state-owned brokerages and pension funds would buy.
Beijing..È initiatives helped to calm markets. But after the state-owned company charged with buying shares to prop up prices announced it would not intervene every day, the Shanghai index fell 11.5 per cent last week.
China..È plunge plus weaker oil prices drove triple digit losses on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday.
The declines come at a time when exports, manufacturing and other Chinese industries are weakening, leaving little economic foundation for higher share prices.
The latest fall probably was triggered by poor performance at publicly traded companies, said Guo Tianyong, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing.
The government reported last week that profits at state-owned companies contracted by 2.3 per cent in July from a year ago, compared with a 0.1 per cent contraction through June.
...We shouldn..È doubt the government..È ability to rescue the market. If they want, they could push up the stock index to 5,000, but it is not necessary for the government to play an excessive role,.. said Guo. ...It still would be better for the market itself to play its role...
Beijing..È surprise Aug. 11 devaluation of its yuan added to investor jitters. They worry the change will lead to money flowing out of China, reducing credit available for trading. The central bank has responded by pumping extra money into credit markets.
The ruling party wants to use the markets to raise money for state companies to reduce debt loads and modernize. The party also wants to encourage stock ownership as a way for families to save for retirement, reducing demand for social spending. But small investors whose holdings have plunged in value say they will no longer buy shares.
Lu Zhen, 29, an employee at a financial firm, said the value of his shares rose by 250,000 yuan ($40,000) over the first half of the year. But he said since the June downturn, he has lost that and an additional 150,000 yuan ($24,000).

108,0,"The condo sales office had barely opened and demand was expected to be strong for suites in The Selby, a 49-storey tower right on the subway line at Sherbourne and Bloor.
Then co-developer Cityzen got an offer it couldn..È refuse: An institutional investor was looking to snap up all 441 condo units and turn them into something rarely seen downtown in decades ... brand new rental apartments.
Incredibly, they aren..È the only ones.
Cityzen Development Group president Sam Crignano says he..È also talking to other institutional investors looking to build rental towers on sites where Cityzen had hoped to eventually construct condos.
...Rents have crept up to the point where the economics of these kinds of deals make a lot of sense,.. says Crignano.
...Plus, let..È be frank, one of the issues we..Èe facing now is affordability. People are finding it harder to just come up with a down payment,.. even for new-build condos which are now averaging $454,476 across the GTA.
Even veteran apartment developers The Minto Group, which owns and manages some 17,000 apartments but has largely shifted its sights to building condos, is now taking another look at rental.
Minto recently raised more than $300 million in equity. It is looking to build or refurbish some 6,000 units of rental housing to service what it sees as a seismic shift in how the young ... and the old ... are going to be living in costly urban centres like Toronto.
...The condo market has shown that there is a deep base of demand now for rental product,.. says Greg Rogers, executive vice president of investments for Minto.
Simple economics and demographics are behind the interest in rental, says Paul Golini, executive vice president of Empire Communities, which is also looking at sites that may make more sense for rental than condo towers.
Thankfully, few expect to see a replay of what happened this week to buyers of 181 condo units in Urbancorp..È Kingsclub project on King St. W.: Three years after that developer took deposits averaging about $40,000 per unit, it quietly decided to convert the three planned condo towers to rental.
Rental is back on the radar because rising rents and low interest rates have combined to drive down capitalization rates dramatically, from about 7.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2003 to 4.2 per cent in the same period of 2014, says Nick Yanovski, managing director of capital markets for commercial brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Canada.
That means rental construction ... which had virtually died in the wake of rent controls -- is actually profitable again. It..È also now seen as a low-risk, long-term hold with the GTA..È population, and land prices, continuing to rise and the vacancy rate at just 1.6 per cent ... even less in the downtown core, says Yanovski.
It..È not just that more first-time buyers are finding themselves priced out of ownership. Many don..È want the responsibility. They want to be downtown, free to seize opportunities in other cities or plough all their spare cash into getting their own companies off the ground.
Strangely enough, aging baby boomers are increasingly in a similar boat.
...Many are living in their retirement savings account,.. says Minto..È Rogers.
Baby boomers are likely to start cashing out on their houses in the coming years to free up money for retirement, travel and to help out their kids, he adds. They like the idea of carefree living in professionally run rental buildings, with the ability to move with two months..Ènotice and no real estate fees if they decide to be closer to the grandkids.
...We..Èe seeing baby boomers who aren..È sure about moving into a condo, so some of them are just renting and trying it on for size to see how it feels,.. says Cityzen..È Crignano.
Builders believe rental demand is likely to keep growing at the expense of home ownership which, as of 2011 in Toronto, stood at historic highs of 65 per cent among 30 to 44-year-olds, up from just 57 per cent in 1991, according to Ottawa-based housing policy researcher Steve Pomeroy.
He..È less confident that institutional investors will get back into rental housing in a big way, given they..Èl be competing with a force that has taken over the last decade in Toronto..È housing market ... mom-and-pop and foreign investors who..Èe bought up condos to rent them out.
Daryl Chong, president and CEO of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association, the umbrella group for apartment owners and property managers, warns that any new rentals are going to be very high end.
In fact, Yorkville seems to be a major focus right now among developers looking for the best rental possibilities.
That..È why the association has proposed a number of incentives ... still under consideration at city hall ... to boost the supply of more affordable rental, from cuts in development charges (they add about $28,000 per two-bedroom unit) to property tax relief.",,,,,,,,27.67,6.51,2.53,3.98,17.59,13.86,3.86,4.7,3.98,0.48,3.73,5.42,0.24,0,0,0,1.2,0,0

113,0,"Many parents struggle to persuade their school-aged children to take to heart the value of eating a healthy, varied diet, one that is colorful, full of vegetables and fruits and light on the bland, refined white grains like bread, pasta and pizza that go down so easily with children. Marlo and Corey, parents of Brooke, 10, and Hunter, 7, want the whole family to sit down to eat one, balanced meal together, but Brooke refuses to eat many foods, preferring pasta with butter and cheese or ramen noodles. Her younger brother almost always follows her lead, and Marlo and Corey have been willing to prepare something different for each child just to be sure that they eat enough.

Marlo and Corey hope to change that pattern, so they, along with Brooke, a sixth grader, and Hunter, a third grader, have agreed to participate in the Picky Eater Project. We (the authors Sally Sampson, founder and editor of the nonprofit children..È cooking magazine Chop Chop and Natalie Digate Muth, a practicing pediatrician and registered dietitian) will coach the whole family. Our hope, and our plan, is that helping the parents to change their approach, encouraging the family to cook together, and adjusting routines can help transform family meals and the children..È food preferences without loading on extra cost, time or family battles.

We started by interviewing the whole family to better understand the children..È food preferences as well as identify opportunities for them to willingly, of their own volition, try new foods. Our first suggestion came as a bit of a (pleasant) surprise to Marlo and Corey; they invited family friends over for dinner. Marlo and Corey made the main course; their guests arrived with some interesting appetizers.

Marlo and Corey prepared steak, rice and Caprese, a tomato and mozzarella salad, which they did not expect the children to eat. Their neighbors brought steamed mussels and a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, among them artichoke leaves, green grapes, oranges, spicy green peppers, carrots, heirloom tomatoes and grape tomatoes. The children had just gotten home from swimming practice and were very hungry. The timing was somewhat strategic, as hungry kids as well as adults, are generally more willing to eat whatever is placed in front of them.

Simply tasting a new food helps to ...train the taste buds... It can take 15 to 20 tries, but eventually a previously rejected taste can become more acceptable, and even preferred. We had coached Marlo and Corey not to make a big deal about new foods ... specifically, not to force or even urge the children to try any of them. We want to nudge the children to try something without pressuring them, which actually sets off a counterproductive response ... ...if they are selling it so hard, it must be gross... We do not subscribe to the ...you have to take just one bite.. school of thought. The parents..Èjob is to offer a variety of foods: The children..È job is to decide if they want to eat those foods or not.

The youngest friend turned out to have a very adventurous palate. As soon as the food was set out she propped herself at the kitchen table and started snacking on the mussels, carrots and tomatoes, and even took a bite of the spicy pepper. At first, the older children didn..È notice. Hunter started trolling through the pantry looking for bread, and Marlo gently redirected him to choose from the foods that were available in the kitchen as ...appetizers... Hunter was hungry, so he ate. He went for the green grapes but also tried a grape tomato and carrots, both of which he liked.

After noticing his friend eating the mussels, his parents told us later, Hunter seemed intrigued. He kept walking by and eyeing them. He said he was afraid to eat the mussels because they might make him throw up. He started sniffing them. He then went to Corey and asked him what he thought about ...that weird-looking food over there. What is it made of?.. He dared Brooke to try one but she refused. ...Gross... He asked Corey to ...please come over and look at this thing. What does it taste like?.. He picked one up and smelled it. Then he licked it.

Marlo says that during this whole scenario, she was biting her tongue and pretending not to notice, stopped herself from cajoling Hunter into trying a mussel. She couldn..È believe what happened next: Hunter took the mussel out of the shell and popped it in his mouth. Chewed. Swallowed. And then said that it was delicious and he really liked it.

Brooke tried one too, as did the other, older visiting child. Brooke said that it was actually pretty good, but that it ...tasted odd. It has the texture of bubble gum but I like how salty it tasted... But one was enough for her. Hunter ate several more and at the end of the night declared mussels to be his new favorite food.

As everyone sat down for dinner, Marlo and Corey implemented the one-meal rule. Brooke and Hunter would not be getting a separate meal tonight. They didn..È pay much attention because they were busy chatting and eating their favorite parts of the dinner with their friends (mostly the steak and white rice). They didn..È eat or even try everything on their plates, and that was O.K.

Marlo and Corey thought that the meal was a big success. Clearly, watching a friend casually eat foods that seemed unfamiliar had more of an influence than their encouragement (although they hope this newfound willingness to try a new food would carry over into their own regular family meals). They also acknowledged that it was difficult not to pressure the children to just take one bite. Both still believed that had the outcome been different ... if the children had not tried any of the foods and did not eat the dinner ... they would have defaulted to their old routine of making the children their own separate meal without thinking twice about it, because they cannot stomach the idea of sending them to bed hungry.

This week, we asked Marlo and Corey to do the following:

1. Agree on a plan. We suggest choosing one or two of the following ...kitchen rules.. and really sticking to them. Our suggestions (from last week..È Picky-Free Parenting Rules):

We will only eat in the kitchen. We will not walk around the house with snacks and drinks. We will not eat dinner in the living room in front of the TV or computer. We may occasionally ...break.. this rule, but very infrequently.

We will eat family meals together whenever possible. You don..È have to eat everything, or anything if you don..È want to, but we will all sit down together at the same time to share a meal.

When we eat, we will be mindful and not have distractions, like television and phones. The rule applies to all of us.

We will not make separate meals. As the parent, I will decide what food is offered. I will take into consideration preferences of other family members. As kids, you can decide what you want to eat of what I offer you, and how much, but I will not be making other meals. If you do not want to eat now, then you may have a fruit or vegetable as a snack later. But that is it.

Snacks will occur at certain predetermined times. We will not graze all day.

2. Transform the fridge Nudge your family towards healthier choices by storing the healthy foods front and center, and the less healthy foods, or the preferred foods you wish your child would eat less of, in harder to see places. Here..È how:

..¢Put the not-so-healthy items in the back of the refrigerator. This way, you and your family will have to work a little bit to find and eat them. That one extra step will go a long way in those foods being eaten less frequently.

..¢Put the fruits and vegetables on the main shelves, front and center in the refrigerator. We have all had healthy produce go bad because it we forgot about it in a fruit and vegetable drawer. If you put them in a location that can..È be missed you and the family will be more likely to eat them. If you prep the healthy stuff, it is more likely to be eaten. Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables and cut them into snack-sized pieces. Put them in clear containers so they won..È be missed.

..¢Place leftovers and food that needs to be eaten soon in an easy-to-find location. Plan to use leftovers for lunches and snacks. For example, use leftover chicken in salads and sandwiches instead of pre-packaged and not-so-healthy (due to high sodium and nitrites) deli meat.

3. Transform the pantry The food available in your pantry can make or break your picky eater project. You will eat much healthier by default when you stock your pantry in a way that makes eating a variety of healthful foods easy. Here..È how:

..¢Throw away all outdated food and any packaged food that contains any variation of sugar as the first or second ingredient. Do the same with the high-sodium products. Does a single serving of chips provide more than half of your child..È recommended sodium level? Toss it. It is O.K. to hold on to items that you can..È toss because you need to use them occasionally (say brown sugar or granulated sugar) or foods that you just aren..È ready to part with, but when you restock the pantry, store them in harder-to-see and reach places.
..¢Now, restock with just the good stuff. A good snack is a whole food, like fruits or vegetables (fresh, frozen, dried, canned or baked), whole grains, nuts or seeds, whole-grain crackers, cheese, plain yogurt or eggs. To evaluate packaged snacks, look for foods with less than 15 percent of calories from saturated fat, no trans fat, less than 210 milligrams of sodium and no more than 13 grams of added sugars per serving.

We asked Brooke and Hunter to do the following:

1. Together with your parents, come up with one new breakfast you..Èl eat this week. Try to choose a breakfast that includes grains (ideally whole grains), protein (like egg, meat, nuts or seeds), a fruit or vegetable and dairy (like milk, yogurt or cheese). We suggested recipes: Double Corn Pancakes, Frittata or
Yogurt Parfait

2. Try one new food that you..Èe never had before.

3. Make one or more of these great tasting snacks: Energy bars, Fruit kabobs.

4. Make a dinner that is customizable, like Fish Tacos.

This year, it is the coyote.

In New York City, where Eastern coyotes are having a breakout year, a glimpse of one of the animals is still rare enough to elicit curious amazement. But in the suburbs, the feeling is different.

In New Castle, N.Y., residents are warring over what to do about the animals, which attacked and killed a number of small dogs in the town this past year. In Saddle River, N.J., a man was bitten by a rabid coyote in April as he worked in his yard. And in Stamford, Conn., dozens of cats have gone missing, and coyotes have started attacking larger dogs, even German shepherds and golden retrievers.

...Ten years ago, it was rare to see coyotes, but they have really exploded on the scene here,.. said Capt. Richard Conkin of the Stamford Police Department. He said that starting in March, the animals seemed to become more aggressive. One resident had to fight a ...small, scrappy coyote.. off with a snow shovel. Another watched as the same coyote chased her shepherd mix to her front door, which she slammed on the animal seconds after her dog made it safely into the house.

Particularly vulnerable are dogs and cats whose owners have installed invisible electric fences, designed to keep the animals from wandering. They trap the pets in while allowing predators unfettered access to the yard.

Michael Dresner remembers the morning in spring 2013 when his family..È dog disappeared. Ruby, a miniature goldendoodle, was in the front yard of their Chappaqua, N.Y., home at 10 a.m. on a Sunday, kept in by an invisible fence.

...My wife, Jill, heard a screeching noise, and we went outside and couldn..È find Ruby,.. he remembered. They searched for hours but never found the dog, who they believe was killed by a coyote. ...Our suspicion is that she was attacked on our front porch and dragged off,.. he said.

...We chose to move up here because it..È wooded and not as densely populated as the city,.. said Mr. Dresner, who relocated from the Upper West Side of Manhattan. ...The concept of living in the country is that you can let your dog outside. But we didn..È expect we would live in an area with animals as violent as coyotes...

Coyotes, which as long as 75 years ago moved into the eastern United States from the West, are viewed by naturalists as a beneficial part of the ecosystem, because they keep rodents in check. They have been sighted in all 21 counties of New Jersey and every town in Connecticut.

They are now so well established ... New York State has an estimated 14,500 breeding pairs ... that any effort to reduce the population would be fruitless, officials say.

...They are an intelligent animal and quickly learn how to survive in their environment, whether that..È the Bronx or Clinton County,.. said Gordon R. Batcheller, the chief wildlife biologist for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. ...They are a permanent presence in New York...

Throughout the region, animal control officers and private trappers work with homeowners and state wildlife officials to capture and euthanize problem or nuisance coyotes. That includes a coyote seen lurking around a school, for example, or one that has preyed on pets in a particular neighborhood.

State officials generally do not allow such coyotes to be relocated because that would merely transfer the problem to another area.

Mostly, the message from wildlife officials is that residents in coyote country need to adapt. ...Just like you keep an eye on your kid in the backyard, you keep an eye on your dog,.. said Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ...It..È not modifying your lifestyle; it..È just common sense...

Tips for peaceful coexistence with coyotes include keeping dogs on leashes, feeding pets only indoors, hazing coyotes (shouting, waving one..È harms) to prevent their comfort with humans and reporting any bold or aggressive behavior.

That advice did not help John Zeug, of Saddle River, N.J., who was spreading lime on his lawn in April when a coyote entered his three-acre property.

...She came running at me, and I made myself big like they say you should do, and she ran into the woods,.. Mr. Zeug, 78, recalled. ...And then I turned around, and 20 seconds later she came up and bit me in my left calf. She let loose thankfully and ran away. I had three puncture wounds, and one oozed for the next six weeks...

The coyote was rabid, and Mr. Zeug required a series of rabies shots. State officials shot the coyote in his yard just as he returned from filling a prescription for antibiotics. They then discovered her six dead pups under his shed.

In Westchester County, in 2010, several children were bitten in communities along Long Island Sound, including a 3-year-old girl in the backyard of Tricia Ellis..È home in Rye.

A necropsy revealed that the coyote was, in fact, healthy. But several months later, in nearby Rye Brook, another coyote, this one rabid, attacked a teenage boy at a birthday party, as well as a man and his 2-year-old daughter.

Ms. Ellis has since moved with her family to another part of Rye. Just last month, she saw a coyote on her street. ...We..Èe very cautious about spending evenings in the garden,.. she said. ...You think it..È safe, but it..È not...

Farther north in New Castle, an affluent town that includes the hamlet of Chappaqua, coyotes have emerged as a flash point in the past year. After numerous reports of missing pets, including the Dresners..È and witness accounts of attacks, opinion in town was so divided that the town supervisor, Rob Greenstein, appointed two advisory committees to make recommendations.

...It appeared that one group was more concerned with protecting coyotes, while the other was more concerned with protecting their pets,.. he said.

The issue attracted the interest of animal-rights activists from outside the county. Soon, the town was being attacked on social media for waging ...coyote jihad...

In the end, Mr. Greenstein had the police chief and the town..È environmental coordinator distill the two sets of recommendations and devise a coyote response plan, which was made final this month. It lays out steps for the local police to follow, depending on the situation. For nonaggressive encounters, the police will, if asked, provide information on how to prevent human-coyote conflict. But if a coyote attacks an attended pet, the episode will be noted on an online map and the police may take steps to remove the wild animal.

...We found that each side was so passionate about the issue that it was better for us to come up with a reasonable compromise,.. said Mr. Greenstein, who is now being challenged for his town supervisor seat by the chairwoman of the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, the more pro-coyote group.

Jim Horton, a licensed trapper in Westchester County, said that he had trapped a dozen coyotes in the past year, but that in ...99 percent of the calls I get for coyotes, I talk the people out of trapping... He added: ...Coyotes are here. They are here to stay, and we..Èe not going to be able to eliminate them from the area...

And coyotes themselves are not always the root of the problem. Two years ago, Mr. Horton offered his services pro bono when one was loitering outside his children..È elementary school in Hawthorne, N.Y. It turned out a neighborhood woman was feeding it.

...We found pork chops on the snow,.. he recalled. ...This lady lived right across from the school field, and she was feeding the coyote. Her response was that she felt bad because she saw the coyote all by itself...",,,,,,,,19.44,10.08,6.31,3.77,14.61,11.87,5.42,2.61,4.12,1.58,6.72,7.89,0.07,0.07,0,0,2.88,0,0

115,0,"Panda lovers, rejoice. Mei Xiang, a giant panda at the National Zoo in Washington, gave birth to healthy twin cubs on Saturday, just three days after the zoo..È staff discovered that she was pregnant.

The first birth, at 5:34 p.m., was broadcast live online on the zoo..È Panda Cam and announced on its official Twitter account. The second birth, at 10:07 p.m., was unexpected and was announced on Twitter. The announcement included a picture that appeared to show the cub being examined by veterinarians.

...It appears healthy,.. the zoo said on Twitter.

Mei Xiang is a minor celebrity in Washington, and her breeding is watched closely by panda fans around the world. Giant pandas mate infrequently, and the birth of a healthy cub is uncommon. Mei Xiang has never before given birth to more than one healthy cub at a time. Bao Bao, one of her cubs who was born in 2013, was followed a day later by a stillborn sibling.

Besides Bao Bao, Mei Xiang has had only two cubs who survived: Tai Shan, who was born in 2005, and a cub who died in 2012 shortly after its birth.

On Saturday, people could watch live online as she gave birth to the first cub, which happened 30 minutes after her water broke as she lay on her back in a narrow cage.

...It doesn..È get old for us,.. Laurie Thompson, a zoo official, told reporters on Saturday. ...We..Èe very excited to share this with you guys, our new cub...

Ms. Thompson, speaking before the second birth, said the mother and the first cub were ...doing really, really well...

The zoo said it expected that Mei Xiang would spend the next one to two weeks in her den bonding with the cub. Veterinarians do not expect to examine the first animal for several weeks, they said. Its sex will be determined at that time.

Zookeepers were not sure Mei Xiang was pregnant until they discovered a four-centimeter-long fetus during an ultrasound procedure Wednesday morning. At the time, the zoo predicted that the cub would be born between Aug. 28 and mid-September, but also warned that there was ...a substantial possibility.. that Mei Xiang could ...resorb or miscarry.. the fetus.

Those warnings, however, appeared to be for naught on Saturday. Not only was one cub born, but two. The zoo said it would release more pictures and video of the first cub soon.

The National Zoo said on Wednesday that it did not know the identity of the cubs..Èfather. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated on April 26 and 27 with semen from both Hui Hui, a giant panda who lives at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in China..È Sichuan Province, and from Tian Tian, a giant panda at the National Zoo.

Hui Hui..È semen was collected in China, frozen and flown to Washington, while zookeepers used what they called ...high-quality fresh semen.. collected from Tian Tian.

...A cub by Mei Xiang and Hui Hui would be very genetically valuable, helping to preserve the genetic diversity of the panda population in human care,.. the zoo said in a statement Wednesday.

All of Mei Xiang..È previous cubs were sired by Tian Tian. Genetic testing will be done to determine the cubs..Èfather, the zoo said.",,,,,,,,18.87,6.84,2.56,4.27,13.85,13.85,3.76,2.74,5.81,0.51,6.15,6.67,0.51,0,0,0,2.74,0,0

118,0,"Arlene Dickinson is best known as one of the tough-talking, no-nonsense venture capitalist co-hosts of CBC..È Dragon..È Den.
The highly successful businesswoman, who the broadcaster bills as a multi-millionaire, came by her success the hard way. She arrived in Calgary as a three-year-old with her immigrant parents, who were fleeing South Africa for a brighter future in Canada.
...My father and mother wanted us to have a better place to live,.. she says. ...But we were the typical immigrant family, with five dollars in our pocket. Growing up, we had very little...
That upbringing has influenced Dickinson..È attitudes toward money, the trappings of material wealth and the things she is trying to pass along to her five grandchildren.
Dickinson left the Den in January after eight seasons, and now shuttles between Calgary, Toronto and a cottage in Collingwood. She runs marketing communications firm Venture Communications, and as a result of her Dragon..È Den experience launched YouInc., which invests in and encourages entrepreneurs.
I asked her about a mistake that taught a memorable lesson and what advice she has for her grandchildren.
Your money mistake is connected to flowers. Can you explain?
Growing up, we had very little, and so buying flowers was an extravagance. I have always loved them, and when I first became successful, I started buying flowers every week for my home. It was something that illustrated to me my success.
But after a while, I asked myself: Why are you doing this every week? The proof of your success should not be in the things you acquire. It should be that your success gives you the ability to do what you want.
So I stopped buying them every week. Flowers are wonderful and I still buy them, but because I love them, not because they prove something.
What is your biggest lesson?
When I was younger, I thought success showed up in certain ways ... the home you had, the car you drove, the jewelry you wore, etc. The lesson as I have gotten older ... and hopefully wiser ... is that material trappings are just that. They trap some of your money and are not what..È important.
My grandma taught me to love people and like things. She..È right. It..È not about accumulating things with your money, but accumulating memories. That doesn..È mean you can..È have nice stuff, you just don..È need a lot of it.
What common mistakes do you see?
People start out with good intentions to save, but get distracted and spend money on the wrong things. Then they get discouraged. It..È like weight loss. You just have to keep at it.
What else do you see?
Many people are afraid to seek advice. They..Èe afraid to admit they don..È have all the answers and so they end up spending money on the wrong things. A good place to start is your bank.
What advice do you give to your grandchildren?
Take 10 per cent of your allowance, or birthday money, and put it away. As you get older, give another 10 per cent of what you make to charity. Live on the rest.
My oldest grandson is 14 and he learned a good lesson recently. He..È just finished Grade 8 and received some money as gifts. He told me he really wanted an Apple Watch and if he saved 10 per cent of the money he had been given he wouldn..È be able to afford it.
He bought the watch. Two weeks later he told me he regretted it. It was cool, but not really worth the big price tag. He said he..È be more careful next time. It was a good lesson.
The other lesson he..È learned is about how small things add up. We have a deal that he can have all the change he can find in the bottom of my purse. We put it away. At the end of the year he had $600. Even I thought: Holy Cow!
Any concluding thoughts?
Good money management starts with education. You can..È manage what you don..È understand, so become literate about financial matters. Learning the language of money management is a critical lesson for all ages. Ask questions, read a lot, get advice. Study money the same way you study anything you are passionate about. Take control and remember to save. That 10 per cent adds up in a meaningful way.",,,,,,,,11.84,19.48,13.08,6.4,11.31,18.12,6.27,3.41,5.59,1.5,7.49,4.5,0.27,0,0.95,0.14,0.54,0,0

120,0,"VICTORIA...Sleep had long since abandoned Montgomery Fraser-Brown by the winter of 2012.
Lying awake at 2 a.m. on a cold December morning, the high school basketball star, then 17, opened his computer and wrote a note to his parents as they slept down the hall in their Victoria home.
...When I lay in my bed all I can think about is images on and off the court seeing friends humiliated and embarrassed,.. he wrote. ...I know I will struggle with these feelings for a long time...
More than two years later, it appears he was right.
Fraser-Brown is one of 13 former student athletes at the prestigious St. Michael..È University School (SMUS) in Victoria who alleged in 2012 that several coaches for both the boys and girls teams routinely bullied and intimidated them with demeaning, profane and sometimes vicious insults that many of them ... and their parents ... say have had lasting repercussions.
A Toronto Star/CTV W5 investigation has detailed how parents and students squared off against educational officials in a now three-year fight over alleged emotional abuse by teachers ... including routinely yelling profanities and epithets such as ...retard,.. ...pussy.. and ...idiot.. ... with impunity.

Reviews of emotional abuse allegations by SMUS and the province..È teacher regulation branch, contained in reports that were mostly kept secret, have exonerated the school and its teachers while acknowledging that profanity-laced insults were directed at students by their teacher-coaches.
The debate raised is this: Are young athletes inspired to excel by aggressive and profane name-calling or does it leave them emotionally damaged?
Verbally aggressive coaching is an ...epidemic.. in youth sports across North America, says sports psychologist and author Dr. Alan Goldberg, who diagnosed Fraser-Brown with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2012 and continues to treat him.
...I get calls every week from parents of athletes in these situations where they..Èe struggling with abusive coaching,.. he says. ...SMUS is far from isolated...
The question left for parents, students and experts involved in sports across the country: Why are coaches ... from hot-tempered volunteer hockey parents to licensed teacher-coaches in private schools ... permitted to behave in ways that are considered unacceptable in any other context involving impressionable young people?
...While it is unfortunate that certain parents remain dissatisfied with their children..È experience at SMUS, it should be readily apparent that at no time did SMUS teachers or administrators behave in an inappropriate fashion,.. reads a statement from the school, provided to the Star and W5 in response to interview requests.
...SMUS and its faculty members have conducted themselves appropriately and in a manner consistent with the values that it practices and seeks to instill into its students: fairness, respect and integrity...
Allegations of emotionally abusive coaching remain whispered within the lavish, manicured grounds of the Victoria private school that markets itself to B.C...È affluent families, who pay more than $45,000 a year in fees for boarding students. A big part of the marketing for those students relies on the name and image of its most famous alumnus.

NBA star Steve Nash, who played basketball at the school in the 1990s before ascending to become one of Canada..È greatest sports heroes, remains at the centre of the school..È mythology and recruitment efforts.
When Fraser-Brown first stepped in Nash..È footsteps on SMUS high school basketball courts in Grade 4, he had the skill and drive that distinguished him on the court as one of the school..È best prospects.
But by Grade 10, the coaching he received changed dramatically, he said in an interview.
That..È the year he was introduced to Ian Hyde-Lay, a teacher-coach with a storied reputation enshrined in the 1990s when he coached Nash.
Hyde-Lay is known as an aggressive taskmaster with a deep knowledge of the game who paced the sidelines with a foul mouth and a determined demeanour.
In reviews conducted by the school and province, most students told investigators they supported Hyde-Lay and his coaching colleagues, some calling them ...the best coaches they..Èe ever had...
One report quotes a student saying SMUS coaches, ...provide encouraging and supportive instruction to help us develop our skills. And sometimes, they may use sharp comments to break through to us, stimulate thinking on the court and bring up the intensity level...
Others are quoted as having an ambivalent relationship with Hyde-Lay ... respecting his knowledge as a coach but questioning his aggressive style.
In video footage, Hyde-Lay can often be seen on the sidelines screaming, cursing and sometimes bowing his head and pulling at his hair.
...The (coach) who is in my face yelling at me and pulling my jersey closer to him is a teacher and is in a position of power over me,.. says Fraser-Brown, who has suffered panic attacks, nightmares, sleepwalking and anxiety.
...The coaches were emotionally abusive to a lot of talented young (athletes), who were destroyed by it...

Fraser-Brown..È mother, Jennifer Fraser, at the time a teacher at the school, gathered testimonies at the request of school headmaster Bob Snowden.
These testimonies contain allegations of aggressive verbal denigration, profanity and scenes of public humiliation during practices, where coaches would call players to stand in front of them while they screamed criticisms at them.
In some cases, students were grabbed and held in place, according to the testimonies.
...These are students who don..È even know each other and they were telling exactly the same story practically,.. she says. ...Year after year after year this is happening...
During one game, Fraser and her husband witnessed their son, who had made a mistake on the court, being grabbed by the jersey by coach Reagan Daly, who held him to his face and screamed, she says.
......Don..È walk away from me when I..È f---ing talking to you,..È. Fraser recalls the coach yelling. ...All the parents heard it. Everyone in the back wall heard it...
She says she was stunned that he faced no disciplinary action by SMUS.
...I would be disciplined, fired,.. she says. ...I..Èe never heard of a teacher ever at that school who speaks to students in that way in a classroom...
All requests to interview the school..È coaches were denied by SMUS.
Colton Stockus, Fraser-Brown..È friend, was also his teammate in Grade 10.
...My final years playing basketball were terrible,.. says Stockus. ...I was playing with fear all the time. It was brutal...

The beginning of the end of Stockus..È high school basketball career happened during a 2011 practice when he took a shot and missed ... a memory he recalls with detailed precision.
...My coach at the time, he blew his whistle and he gathered the whole team around and he said, ...Let..È face it guys, Colton..È the worst shooter on the team, don..È pass it to him,..Èin front of everybody...
He left the team after Grade 10 and returned as a team manager the following year to stay close with his friends.
By Grade 12, Stockus and Fraser-Brown had quit the game they once loved.
Fraser-Brown has never played again. He has been in therapy for PTSD ever since ... a condition that is surprisingly common for competitive young athletes, says Goldberg.
Stockus says the coaching impacted him deeply. While once a social kid, he started keeping to himself, struggling with his moods and feeling anxious.
While he has recently started playing basketball informally with pals at Ryerson, Hyde-Lay..È voice still rings in his head, he says.
...I can still hear his voice in my head saying I..È not good enough. I still get anxious. I have big trust issues. It..È unpleasant to think that there are new kids there now going through the same things...
Stockus..È father, George, says he has also seen troubling changes in his son.
...My son internalizes things and doesn..È want to emote. It..È one of the most painful things to see...
His older child, Sydney, had stress levels during her athletic career at SMUS and returned home after games in tears. She had anxiety and trouble sleeping. And it stayed with her.
She had to temporarily abandon her studies in her freshman year at the University of Southern California, because of ongoing emotional issues stemming from SMUS coaching, she says.
...Thinking back to what I experienced in the basketball program and what I..Èe seen transpire at SMUS, my eyes are very open to the lasting marks these coaches have had not only on parts of my psyche, but my family..È,.. she says. ...Now, as a graduate and young professional, I still catch myself and need to remind myself that my best is good enough despite these memories of being conditioned otherwise...
She has only picked up a basketball once since high school, she says.
George Stockus..È worries about the long-term mental health of his children are compounded by the $25,000 he donated to SMUS to build the basketball gym.
...I didn..È know I was donating to the house of shout,.. he says. ...If you have a government that doesn..È have an interest in holding a school accountable and a school that doesn..È want to be held accountable, nothing happens...
Yelling profanity-laced insults at students may be a firing offence for teachers in a classroom, but in a school gym teachers are mistakenly celebrated as inspirational figures, says Goldberg, a Massachusetts-based sports psychologist and one of the continent..È leading experts in his field.
...When kids are abused, and they..Èe not protected, and it goes on for an extended amount of time, they end up being traumatized by it,.. says Goldberg, who was invited by B.C...È Representative for Children and Youth to speak about coach abuse at a 2013 conference.
...They memorize those experiences ... the images, the emotion, the anxiety attached to it, the thinking that is associated with it ... that will stay in their system. And it can have lasting implications on vulnerable young people for years to come...
In May 2011, a parent and lawyer named Patricia Lane, whose son played basketball at SMUS, wrote a complaint and gave it to a member of the school..È board of directors.
...Here is the secret,.. reads the complaint, obtained by the Star and W5. ...There is child abuse occurring routinely in the form of severe teacher bullying in the high school basketball department. It is now an accepted part of the culture...
Lane declined to be interviewed for this article.
In February 2012, the father of two SMUS students sent a scathing letter to school administrators detailing how they have lost confidence and joy in the game they love ...due to the insults, ridicule and expressions of rage.. from Hyde-Lay.
...Quite simply, Ian Hyde-Lay is a bully and should not hold a position of power over a group of adolescent boys. He swears at the boys . . . screams at them throughout games for what he perceives as their ineptitude, and rages over their inability to please him...
The complaint letter prompted a written response from Hyde-Lay himself.
...I freely admit I am competitive to a fault, with my burning desire for the team to perform well and win too often resulting in outbursts I wish I could take back,.. reads his email response, obtained by the Star. ...I need to do a far better job controlling my frustration when mistakes or lack of effort take place...
He also says his critics ignore the ...literally thousands of extra hours I spend with all our players in and out of season to assist them in playing a sport they love,.. and that ...I reinforce to the boys on every possible occasion the values of loyalty, teamwork, humour, unselfishness and honesty...
By the spring of 2012, complaints were intensifying, internal correspondence shows.
...Nepotism, favoritism, neglect and abuse run rampant,.. one couple wrote to school officials listing, ...incessant yelling, name calling, public shaming and favoritism.. by basketball coaches.
Fraser and her husband, Tom Brown, also complained.
Headmaster Robert Snowden..È initial response acknowledged deep concerns about his coaches.
...The first thing I do want to reassure you about is that things will change for next year, and we will do our best to make sure that the boys..Èbasketball experience is as positive as possible, with different coaching,.. he wrote in an April 4, 2012, email to Fraser and her husband. ...The most important thing is to do what is right by the students...
By May, the school was apparently considering placing Hyde-Lay on probation.
Snowden told one parent that he is ...working on a program.. for Hyde-Lay that will help him ...examine his approach to coaching and address the issues that have arisen...
In a written statement to the Star and W5, Snowden says he took the allegations to the Saanich Police Department in May 2012.
The police determined, says the statement, ...that this was not a police matter, as none of the elements for a criminal charge were made out...
In a police occurrence report, obtained by the Star, the investigating officer wrote, ...If the allegations were brought forward, it was bordering on criminal harassment...
In June 2012, Snowden sent an email calling players and parents to a meeting to discuss complaints about ...the negative experience of a number of boys.. on the basketball team, the invitation read.
It appeared to be a step toward acknowledgement and change, Montgomery recalls: ...The headmaster was going to apologize for the coaching conduct and, you know, offer a resolution of sorts...
But staff members felt they had not had a fair hearing.
The evening before the public meeting, Snowden, in an email exchange with Lane, wrote ...I am afraid we are at a serious impasse...
The next day, the school chapel filled with players and parents to address the allegations openly. Snowden announced he would launch an independent investigation and conduct a review of the athletic department.
Then, a parent asked that anyone who supported the coaches raise a hand, say several witnesses interviewed.
...A lot of kids raised their hands and me and Colton and a few others sat there with our hands down and so everyone stared at us,.. Montgomery recalls.
The boys were publicly outed to the entire school community as whistleblowers, they say.
Word spread quickly among the faculty about the identity of the complainers.
Colton Stockus says high school, for him, became a survival exercise: Glares, cheap-shot comments, and even faculty taunting.
Fraser-Brown suffered panic attacks in class and was forced to drop some.
...I wasn..È able to write exams in grades 11 or 12 and I pretty much didn..È really learn anything,.. he says. ...I constantly felt threatened, scared about walking through a corridor and seeing my coaches or other teachers glaring at me...

Snowden, meanwhile, commissioned two separate reports into the allegations.
The school didn..È share the first report conducted by the ombudsman of independent schools, Robert Ellis, with the Star and W5.
But a summary of the findings, obtained by the news organizations, says Ellis could make no clear findings given the two conflicting accounts.
In the second review, Vancouver lawyer John Sanderson, quoting anonymous students who said those criticizing the coaches were spreading ...nasty lies.. and attempting to ...manufacture evidence of abuse,.. concluded that while coaches ...openly cursed,.. he found, ...there were no behaviours that were deliberately abusive or demeaning...
The divide between the majority of the 35 students he interviewed who supported the coaches and those who were critical, he wrote, was rooted in differing abilities to transition into more serious high school competition.
...For some players, what was a fun game in which they could fully compete with their teammates and others, has become an increasingly demanding burden on their ego and self-confidence...
He recommended no disciplinary action against the teachers but did suggest a need to ...review and reconsider behaviour.. of coaches, saying they, ...must set a positive and better example for the players and they should curb the use of foul language... He also recommended a coaching code of conduct be created for the school.
Goldberg, who reviewed the findings, wrote a report saying Sanderson ...explained away.. emotionally abusive treatment of players as ...coaching passion...
...In my experience .._ athletes do not complain about the adjustment to a higher level. Playing basketball is their dream. They do not write testimonials blaming the coaches if they are having trouble or don..È have enough playing time. They do not risk the wrath of the coaches, their fellow players or the student body. If a group of athletes have gotten to the point of launching a formal complaint, there is a good reason for it and I am deeply concerned and dismayed that Mr. Sanderson completely minimized and explained away their complaints of emotional abuse...
Sanderson declined to be interviewed for this story. In a written statement, he said: ...My report was based solely on the facts given to me by the athletes themselves in lengthy and private interviews with each of them .._ I am confident in the accuracy of my report...
One of the dozen players who provided testimony and says she suffered on the girls team calls Sanderson..È findings offensive.
...I..Èe had the toughest of tough coaches and I think there..È nothing wrong with that,.. says the athlete, who now attends university in Ontario and asked not to be identified for fear that speaking out could compromise her acceptance into an academic program. ...I can see the difference between that and being tormented. I was completely trapped...
Troubled by Sanderson..È conclusions, several parents turned to the B.C. Teacher Regulation Branch, responsible for overseeing the conduct of the profession. Jennifer Fraser filed the complaint on behalf of a group of parents.
Bruce Preston, a retired judge appointed as commissioner of the oversight body, authored the final rulings in April 2014 ... nearly two years after the investigation began.
The findings aren..È public. Fraser says she is prevented from discussing the results for fear of losing her teaching licence.
SMUS officials provided the Star and W5 with redacted versions of the report that show Preston dismissed complaints against four teachers. While he acknowledges the concerns, he concludes they are outweighed by the positive statements of other players.
(Mobile users, tap here to read findings about Ian Hyde-Lay.)
Uncensored copies of those decisions, obtained by the Star and W5, reveal specific allegations presented to Preston including coaches yelling comments such as ...What the f--- are you doing?..È...You are all f---ing terrible..Èand ...You are a f---ing idiot...È. Hyde-Lay himself, according to Preston..È uncensored decision, was alleged to have yelled ...f---ing retards.. and ...f---ing pussies.. at players.
Preston concluded: ...Mr. Hyde-Lay has used obscenities .._ and that the use of profanity in a school setting is inappropriate conduct... But Preston decided a disciplinary panel, if asked to review the evidence, would not find professional misconduct because ...the swearing was not intended to be heard by students...

125,1,"BROOKLYN, NY...After several months of diligent effort, staff members working on Hillary Clinton..È 2016 presidential campaign confirmed Wednesday they have made significant progress in conditioning her to convincingly recreate and convey a limited spectrum of emotions.

According to aides who drill the Democratic frontrunner for several hours each day on her emotional responses to a variety of stimuli, Clinton can now effectively exhibit concern, mild excitement, and incredulity. Intensive training is reportedly still underway on some of the more challenging-to-produce emotions, such as polite interest and personal warmth.

...The headway Hillary has made is really encouraging, especially when you consider what we started with,.. said staffer Cheryl Dum.s, who later added that when she began working with Clinton, the candidate was only able to fluctuate between stony neutrality and terrifying anger. ...We..Èe very proud that she can now display a virtually indistinguishable facsimile of empathy. It..È the result of a behavioral modification technique in which we rigorously reinforce any approximations of compassion that happen to flash across her face while she listens to the concerns of voters...

...We..Èe hopeful that she..Èl have a functional range of 11 or even 12 emotions by the time the early primaries roll around,.. Dum.s added.

In her current program of operant conditioning, Clinton is reportedly shown a series of images...such as a widow crying at her spouse..È funeral, a family opening presents on Christmas morning, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich...designed to induce specific emotional responses, and depending on the appropriateness of her subsequent facial expressions and other body language, she is either rewarded or punished.

Staffers said they began the process by slowly and painstakingly pairing a correct reaction with a correct stimulus. They reportedly first trained the former secretary of state to reproduce a ...happy.. emotion by repeatedly showing her a photo of a small child playing with a kitten and then rubbing a soft cloth on her face while physically holding her mouth in the shape of a smile until, eventually, she could display a passable simulacrum of joy.

...There are definitely some crossed wires, like how she nods and applauds after hearing the story of a family that lost their home to foreclosure,.. campaign consultant Allison Stevens said. ...But it..È just a matter of time and patience. When she gets a response wrong, we spritz her in the face with cold water from a spray bottle, and when she gets one right, we let her work on her memoirs for a little bit or call her ...Madam President..Èin soothing tones...she loves that...

...She also really likes Luna Bars,.. Stevens continued. ...She..Èl do just about anything for a Luna Bar!..

Staff members acknowledged that Clinton would be subject to extremely rapid regression if she were not conditioned with absolute consistency. They told reporters they didn..È want her to go back to the days when people she met on the campaign trail would voice their deepest worries and she would respond to each by loudly stating, ...I am feeling empathy toward you...

...There have definitely been some setbacks,.. senior aide Tim Balducci said. ...Yesterday, when a reporter asked for her thoughts on the surge in refugees crossing the Mediterranean, she panicked and rapidly cycled through the eight or so responses we..È equipped her with thus far before making a painfully stilted reply.

153,1,"BOSTON...Pinpointing the phenomenon as the single greatest predictor of human mortality, a paper published Wednesday in The New England Journal Of Medicine has found that people with deceased family members run an extremely high risk of dying themselves.

The groundbreaking study, which tracked the health and well-being of 85,000 subjects over a period of 40 years, discovered that people who have one or more relatives who have passed away are very likely, one day, to die as well.

...It appears that individuals with a family history of death have a strong genetic predisposition toward dying,.. said the paper..È lead author, Dr. Samantha Booth, who explained that the finding held true regardless of a subject..È race, nationality, gender, or socioeconomic status. ...Based on anecdotal evidence, we..Èe long suspected an inherited trait could play a major role in determining whether a person dies, but we were surprised to see just how strong the correlation truly is...

...Unfortunately, for members of this cohort, death appears to be all but inevitable,.. she continued.

According to the study..È authors, the likelihood of future mortality remains high regardless of whether one..È immediate family members have died, or whether only more distant relations have passed on. Based on their findings, researchers hypothesize that death is handed down through individual lineages, becoming a devastating family curse that is passed from parent to child and which tends not to skip a generation.

In addition, a separate study of some 8,000 individuals who died in the Hartford, CT area found that every one of the deceased had ancestors who had died before them, further suggesting a family link.

While people from afflicted lineages can reportedly prolong their lives by developing healthy habits such as a nutritious diet and regular exercise, researchers stated that, in the end, no matter how many precautions they take, their genetic susceptibility to dying will win out.

...We recommend alerting your doctor if there..È a history of death in your family, and if you aren..È certain, you should ask your parents if they know of any fatalities among your relatives,.. Booth said. ...This is also important information to know before deciding to have children yourself. Even if your own family is alive and well, it..È possible there is death somewhere in your partner..È ancestry...

...If you have a grandparent or even a great-grandparent who has died, then sadly, the odds of your kids eventually dying are quite high,.. she added.
