Nearly 43 percent of American voters support the idea of beginning the official impeachment process, a recent poll found
Donald Trump received an unwanted present on his 71st birthday - lower presidential approval ratings than three of his predecessors. 
Of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama, only Mr Bush reached the 60 per cent disapproval mark. 
But multiple polls showed Mr Trump’s approval ratings dropped  to just 36 percent over the weekend, close to the all time 35 per cent low he achieved in March. 
Nearly 43 percent of American voters also support the idea of beginning the official impeachment process for Trump, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll published this week. 
The sacking of FBI director James Comey has heightened fears over Trump’s unpredictable leadership, according to Inderjeet Parmar, professor of international politics at City University of London.

The downward spiral in Trump’s popularity comes after his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. Most US states were in favour of the Paris Agreement according to the Yale programme on climate change communication, which found that almost 70 per cent of Americans wanted to stay within the agreement.
There is also the continuing investigation by the Senate intelligence committee into alleged Russian meddling in the US elections.
