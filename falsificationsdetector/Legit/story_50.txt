"You want to go to Kenya? I'll pay for you to go to Kenya," Sean Hannity said.

Fox News host Sean Hannity doesn't just want President Barack Obama out of the White House come 2017. He wants him out of the country altogether. 
The conservative commentator on Tuesday offered to pay for a one-way flight to Kenya for the president and his family, harkening back to the false birther conspiracy that resurfaced on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. 
"I have an offer for the president. I will charter a plane for you and your family," Hannity said on his daily radio show. "I will charter it to the country of your choice. You want to go to Canada? I'll pay for you to go to Canada. You want to go to Kenya? I'll pay for you to go to Kenya. Jakarta [in Indonesia], where you went to school back in the day, you can go back there."
Hannity added one condition: Obama "can't come back."
Though Hannity did not claim Tuesday that the president was born outside the country, on his prime-time TV show the host has repeatedly entertained the debunked notion that Obama was born in Kenya, and he joined Donald Trump in calling for the president to release his long-form birth certificate in 2011. 
The comments came a day after White House press secretary Josh Earnest dodged the question of whether Obama would consider moving out of the country should Trump become president. 
“He’s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn’t support,” Earnest said during a press briefing Monday.
