White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is reportedly taking on a new role in the Trump administration, overseeing the entire communications operation.
The new job, which doesn't yet have an official title, will apparently take Spicer away from some of his day-to-day duties at the podium.
It's unclear who will take over as the new full-time press secretary, although one name that has been mentioned is LifeZette founder Laura Ingraham.
On "Fox & Friends" this morning, Ingraham said she's open to a position in the White House if it's a role in which she could do well and advance President Trump's agenda.
"There's so much at stake for the country and the future," Ingraham said. "I would think about it."
She added, however, that she's not necessarily sure if press secretary is the role she would pick for herself.
She pointed out that she has a background in law and strategic political communications, so she could fill many positions in the administration.
"I'm not sure if the press secretary thing is something I'm dying to do," Ingraham said.
Ainsley Earhardt noted that the press secretary has to be "tough as nails," asking if Ingraham would be intimidated by the role.
"You're joking, right?" Ingraham quipped.
"It would be fun to do it every now and then, so who knows," she added.
