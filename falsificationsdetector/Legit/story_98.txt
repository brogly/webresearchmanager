President Donald Trump took aim at the growing controversy over the investigation into his campaign's possible ties to Russia in flurry of tweets sent on Monday night.
"Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia[?]" he asked in a message posted to Twitter.
He also cited "Russian speech money to Bill, the Hillary Russian 'reset,' praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company," as possible further areas of inquiry.
"Trump Russia story is a hoax," he declared.
"Podesta Russian Company" appears to be a reference to calls from Rep. Louie Gohmert to investigate John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's election campaign chairman, for his ties to Russia. Gohmert has questioned Podesta's 2011 role in an investment fund with ties to the Russia government.
Former President Bill Clinton received $500,000 in 2010 from a Russian finance corporation called Renaissance Capital, one of many detailed in Peter Schweizer's book "Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich."
The latest tweets come after the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, has come under fire for his handling of the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election.
Late Monday, his Democratic counterpart, Rep. Adam Schiff, took the nearly unprecedented step of calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the probe.
Members of the House Intel Committee typically avoid partisan politics, but Nunes raised eyebrows when he shared new details of the investigation -- specifically that Trump associated may have been surveilled -- with the White House and the press before sharing them with his colleagues on the committee.
Nunes revealed on Monday that he reviewed sensitive files while on White House grounds.
