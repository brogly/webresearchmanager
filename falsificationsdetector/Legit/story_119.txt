Judge Andrew Napolitano reacted to President Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying his departure was a long time coming.
Napolitano said Comey's behavior during the Hillary Clinton email probe violated respected regulatory levers of the bureau.
"You don't make a recommendation to the attorney general in public," he said, referencing last July's announcement that Comey concluded that Clinton had not broken any laws.
Napolitano said Comey "demeaned" the work of rank-and-file justice department employees and said he "undermined the integrity" of the office.
He also blasted Comey for his actions after the discovery of potentially incriminating emails last October on the laptop of former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.).
