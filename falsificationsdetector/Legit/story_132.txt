Ted Haggard, the megachurch pastor and National Association of Evangelicals president felled by a gay sex and drugs scandal in 2006, says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi regularly sent words of comfort and support in the two year following his fall. Haggard is the subject of a forthcoming HBO documentary by Alexandra Pelosi, the speaker’s daughter.
