Metro Manila (CNN Philippines) — Former President Benigno Aquino III would want to see for himself how Senator Leila De Lima is doing after she was arrested.
In an interview after the Liberal Party caucus on Monday, Aquino said he is planning to visit De Lima in the Philippine National Police custodial center.
Aquino said he has just sent a request for permission to visit the senator.
"We sent a letter this morning. We are waiting for a response for permission to visit," Aquino said.
De Lima is facing criminal charges before Muntinlupa regional trial court, and has been arrested for a drug case filed by the Department of Justice. Two more drug cases were filed against her — still awaiting action by the RTC.
DOJ accused De Lima of receiving drug money from inmates running the illegal drug trade at the National Bilibid Prisons.

The former President said, he and De Lima have a lot to talk about.
"Syempre check on how she is. And find out 'yung, basically talk about so many things with her," said Aquino.
Aquino added, if he would be allowed to bring something for De Lima, he'd probably bring "some chocolates."
