President Trump has lashed out at top Democrats over their past interactions with Russian officials.
On Friday morning, he tweeted a photo of Senator Chuck Schumer and Russian President Vladimir Putin eating donuts with the message, "We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!"
A few hours later, Trump tweeted a link to a Politico article featuring a photo which it says contradicts House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's claim that she has not met with the Russian ambassador.
Politico says the photo from 2010 shows her sitting across a table from Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, along with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and others.
The president commented on the report by writing, "I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it."
However, the Democratic lawmakers quickly responded.
 
These exchanges occurred amid controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not telling Congress he had reportedly met with the Russian ambassador twice.
