The family of Dominic Puopolo has close links with Bill and Hillary Clinton
 
A homeless man whose family are believed to have been friends with the Clintons has been arrested by police in Florida, after producing a video in which he threatened to kill President-elect Donald Trump at his inauguration ceremony.
Dominic Puopolo, 51, was detained at a local branch of Subway in Miami and reportedly admitted to officers he had posted the clip on Twitter.
In the video, Mr Puopolo said he intended to assassinate the President-elect using a Wesley Scopes Booth high-powered rifle during Mr Trump’s ceremony in Washington DC on Friday. He repeatedly referred to himself as ‘Jesus Christ’ as his messages became more incoherent
Mr Puopolo appeared in court in Miami following his arrest, and his defence lawyer recommended he be given a full psychological evaluation to determine his mental state. 
He was charged with threatening to harm a public servant and awaits trial. His bail was set at $1 million, once medical professionals deemed his was stable enough to be released.
 
According to the Miami Herald, Mr Puopolo’s mother Sonia, a pro-Democrat activist, was among those killed during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when American Airlines Flight 11 was flown into the Twin Towers in New York.
The Puopolo family is thought to have been friends with the Clinton family, and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly read the eulogy at Mrs Puopolo's funeral.
 
A photograph from the funeral in 2001 meanwhile appeared to show Mr Puopolo sitting two seats away from Mrs Clinton as they listened to the service.
 
Following the presidential election in November, the FBI reportedly began to monitor Twitter after users made a series of calls for someone to assassinate Mr Trump before he takes office.
