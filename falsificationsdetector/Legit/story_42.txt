 Former Georgia Senator Robert Brown has died of an apparent suicide. 
Macon police say the 61-year-old was found in his home Thursday, dead from a gunshot wound. 
Brown was first elected in a special election in 1991 to fill an unexpired term. 
He was elected democratic leader in 2005. 
He left the Senate earlier this year to launch a failed bid for mayor of Macon. 
"He was one of the brightest people I've ever worked with," said former House Democratic Leader DuBose Porter. "One of the most loyal political friends you could ever have, a true believer."
"I am deeply saddened about the death of State Senator Robert Brown. He was an extraordinary public servant who cared about working-class people and issues such as education, healthcare and job creation not only in Macon, but throughout the state," said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. "He was a strong Democratic leader in the General Assembly and a tenacious fighter for his constituents. He was not only a colleague, but also a friend and mentor to me for many years while we served in the Senate. His passing is a great loss for the entire state of Georgia."
