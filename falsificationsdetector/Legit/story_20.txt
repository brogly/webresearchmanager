In his opening monologue tonight, Tucker Carlson reacted to former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Tucker said there were many bombshell revelations in the hearing, including Comey's admission that he caved in to a request from former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to refer to the Hillary Clinton email probe as a "matter," not an investigation.
Tucker said Comey has been inconsistent by making untrue statements that echoed the Clinton campaign's talking points, and then refusing to publicly say the truth about President Donald Trump not being under FBI investigation related to the Russia probe.
"Why did Comey make and then leak detailed memos about his meetings with President Trump, but apparently do nothing in response to the political pressure he received from the previous attorney general, Loretta Lynch?" Tucker asked.
He added that this begs the question if this was the only time the Obama administration exerted political pressure on Comey.
"It might be worth asking," Tucker said.
He added that perhaps the most important revelation to emerge from the hearing is that allegations about collusion between Trump and Russia are starting to look weaker than ever.
He explained that Comey not only confirmed that Trump was never under FBI investigation, he also offered no evidence or testimony suggesting the president should be under investigation.
