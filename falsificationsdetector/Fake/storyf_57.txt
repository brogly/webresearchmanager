It doesn’t matter the party former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton may be, just like her daughter Chelsea Clinton, we are one when it comes to tragedy.
Clinton just  reacted to Wednesday’s shooting at the Republican Congressional Baseball Game practice.
“2 sides take the field tomorrow, but we’re all ultimately one team,” Clinton said in a tweet early Wednesday evening.
 
Former President Obama also send his “best wishes and prayers” for the victims, according to Politico.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also reached out across the aisle when she spoke on the House floor Wednesday.
“I have been probably the target of more, political target of probably more threats than anyone perhaps other than the President of the United States Barack Obama. And so I pray for Barack Obama, and now I continue to pray for him,” she said. “And I pray for Donald Trump, that his presidency will be successful and that his family will be safe.”
