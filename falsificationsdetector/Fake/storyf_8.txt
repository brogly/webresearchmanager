An mandate to allow transgender volunteers to serve in the military beginning this summer has been delayed indefinitely as senior military personnel from multiple branches of the armed forces continue to hold serious reservations, according to news reports.
On May 8, a memo from Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work ordered heads of the armed services to gauge the military’s “readiness to begin accepting transgender applicants on July 1, 2017,” according to .
 
However, that memo had some language in it that seems to open the door for criticism of the policy, which may very well have precipitated this rollback by .
“The personnel policies of this Department are designed to enhance the readiness and lethality of the force that protects our country,” Work wrote in the memo according to USA Today.
“We do not intend to reconsider prior decisions unless they cause readiness problems that could lessen our ability to fight, survive and win on the battlefield.”
Everything after the word “unless” is what we want to pay attention to here. It opens the door for high-ranking officers to make arguments against the policy change in the name of bettering the military’s capability to perform effectively.
The assessments Work ordered were due back by May 31, and here we are in June with what is calling an “indefinite delay.”
According to Military Times, the move is on hold “as senior leaders within each of the services voice lingering concerns about the Obama-era policy intended to end discrimination but dismissed by critics as social experimentation.”
Those critics have it exactly right.
TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
