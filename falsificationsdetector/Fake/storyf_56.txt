President Donald Trump has attacked what he called a “phony story” after a report that he is under investigation for possible obstruction of justice by the special counsel probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
“They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,” Trump wrote on Twitter, later repeating his accusation that the probe is a “witch hunt.”
According to the Washington Post, special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice.
A source familiar with the Mueller investigation confirmed the Post report, saying an examination of possible obstruction of justice charges was “unavoidable” given Comey’s testimony, although the issue may not become the main focus of the probe.
