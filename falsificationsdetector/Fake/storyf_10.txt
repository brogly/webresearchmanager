A former US intelligence worker is suing James Comey and other top government officials, alleging the FBI and US authorities intentionally concealed evidence that showed widespread surveillance of private American citizens, reports Circa.
The suit was filed earlier this week by Dennis Montgomery, a contractor who provided the FBI with evidence that the intelligence services were collecting private information without a proper warrant; including phone and financial data.
“This domestic surveillance was all being done on computers supplied by the FBI,” Montgomery told Circa. “So these supercomputers, which are FBI computers, the CIA is using them to do domestic surveillance.”
According to Montgomery, more than 20 million Americans have been surveilled and “unmasked” by the intelligence community, revealing personal information such as credit card data and medical records.
“They’re doing this domestic surveillance on Americans, running a project on U.S. soil,” Montgomery said. “Can you imagine what someone can do with the information they were collecting on Americans, can you imagine that kind of power.”
The suit claims former FBI chief James Comey was aware of the information presented by Montgomery, and intentionally covered up the material to continue “unconstitutional surveillance.”
“Plaintiffs were assured that the FBI, under Defendant Comey, would conduct a full investigation into the grave instances of illegal and unconstitutional activity set forth by Montgomery,” says the filing. “However, the FBI, on Defendant Comey’s orders, buried the FBI’s investigation because the FBI itself is involved in an ongoing conspiracy to not only conduct the aforementioned illegal, unconstitutional surveillance, but to cover it up as well.”
TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
