Since I started this website last week, we have had:
– More than 1,000,000 visitors to our site
– Thousands of comments on our stories
– Hundreds of thousands of Likes and Shares on Facebook
– And a very small handful of people questioning the legitimacy of our stories, despite a disclaimer at the bottom of the page stating that our stories are not based in reality. Although, one would think the ridiculousness of the stories would not necessitate a disclaimer.
Some people even made youtube videos about the stories (original video was deleted):
So whether you are angry about Obama’s pedophile ring that he ran out of the White House, or Whoopi’s statements about US military widows, calm down… and grow up; neither ever happened.
.
When I started this site, I had no idea that the stories would garner this much attention. While writing them, I was aiming for stories that no one would believe, but rather would be satirical in an age where disinformation is so prevalent.
Just for fun, I decided to post some of the stories in Trump fan groups on Facebook to see the reactions.
To my surprise, the Trump masses embraced my stories as fact, almost universally. It seemed that there wasn’t anything I could write that was too wild or outrageous to be believed by this particular audience.
If I wrote about CNN being fake news and connected to ISIS, readers would agree wholeheartedly with my fabricated article. If I wrote about a black liberal or Obama supposedly saying something controversial, the response was unbridled racism and hatred. When I wrote about Hillary Clinton’s new emails that proved she was a child sacrificing maniac, people screamed for her head.
I was startled that in today’s world, so many could be so willfully ignorant. It’s truly a frightening time when a group of people screaming, “FAKE NEWS!” at the top of their lungs, live, eat and sleep falsehoods.
I, however, cannot claim that I did not enjoy my week of deception. There was something artful about the whole process. Even writing this now, I feel like one of the Buddhist monks who spend months or years creating a sand mandala only to wipe it up and destroy it upon completion. However, I find it morally necessary to clean up this mess, for a society that loses the ability to distinguish fact from fiction is a society vulnerable to anything.
Here’s a list of some of our more popular and outrageous stories over the week. Please take the time to read through some of the comments as they are both frightening and hilarious:
