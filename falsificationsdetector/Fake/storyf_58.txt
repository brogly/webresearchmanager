The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is rounding up dozens of Iraqi Christians. The raid took place mostly in Michigan where we have a huge number of Middle Eastern population.
Those who have been arrested are Christians in danger of going home and most have never committed a crime of any sort.
Assyrian-Christian Steve Oshana, director of A Demand for Action, has blamed Trump for allowing ICE to deport Christians back to places like Iraq, where the John Kerry said ISIS is committing genocide. “Someone like the President of the United States has to step in, he has promised in the past that he was going to protect our community, but the people that are being sent back now are being sent back as a direct deal between the United States and the Iraqi government to accept these people,” Oshana said to Catholic news site EWTN.
ICE claims that the raids are “consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis.” That didn’t stop protesters from gathering outside of detention centers, trying to block buses from departing while shouting that ICE is a racist organization. And according to Wisam Naoum, ICE intentionally waited to conduct the raids until the local Chaldean Catholic Assyrian assembled for mass.
“This is a deliberate attack on the Chaldean Catholic Assyrian community of Detroit by the Administration. They waited until Sunday when our community would be going to church and gathering with their families and have rounded up to 40-60 community members,” Naoum said in a Facebook post.
In January, Trump Trump tweeted, “”Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue.”
