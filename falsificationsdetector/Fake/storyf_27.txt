Hillary Clinton is riding her high horse after she lost not her first but second presidential election. Given she did make it farther than her first attempt but she had to rig the primary to make that happen.
Hillary Clinton has been tied to Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch who was in charge of her investigation into Hillary’s emails. The most notable of these connections was the secret meeting of Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch during the investigation of Hillary Clinton.
What they could be talking about obviously had nothing to do with the investigation … or so Hillary says and she always speaks the truth.
But Loretta Lynch played a large role for the Clinton campaign and that is exactly what former Attorney General Michael Mukasey had to say about the actions of Loretta Lynch.
Mukasey made an appearance on NewsMax to expose just how corrupt Lynch really was.
Not only was she so incompetent of her investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails to the point of seeming purposeful, but she also was so tied with the Clinton campaign that she acted as an “arm” of the Clintons.
Mukasey had nothing but disgust for Lynch and her ruining the good name of the position of Attorney General and the stain that she left behind after she let Hillary go.
Here is what Mukasey had to say:
MICHAEL MUKASEY: WHAT MAKES IT EGREGIOUS IS THE FACT, AND I THINK IT’S OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A FACT, THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ADJUSTING THE WAY THE DEPARTMENT TALKED ABOUT ITS BUSINESS SO AS TO COINCIDE AS TO THE WAY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TALKED ABOUT THAT BUSINESS. 
IN OTHER WORDS IT MADE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ESSENTIALLY AN ARM OF THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN. THAT IS REALLY A BETRAYAL OF THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS INDEPENDENCE. CLEARLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS CLEARLY IN THE TANK FOR SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON.
Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch are as guilty as they come and it is only a matter of time before their lies and crimes catch up to them.
