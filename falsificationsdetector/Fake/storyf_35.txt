Former President Benigno Aquino III on Thursday visited Senator Leila de Lima at the Philippine National Police (PNP) Custodial Center where she has been detained over illegal drug charges.
PNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos told the media that Aquino, a close friend and fellow Liberal Party member of the senator, arrived at 1:45 p.m. in the detention facility.
Aquino’s visit lasted for about two hours, according to police sources.
Last Tuesday, Aquino said he planned to visit De Lima to check on her condition and “talk about so many things with her.”
The former chief executive also said he wanted to bring De Lima some chocolates.
In a press briefing earlier, Carlos said PNP chief Director General Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa received Aquino’s letter asking permission to visit the senator this morning.
Asked in an earlier interview if he had approved Aquino’s request, Dela Rosa said, “I have no problem with that. Anybody can visit provided gusto rin ng senador na papasukin, pabisitahin yung bisita with the clearance of the concerned which is the senator.”
De Lima has been detained at the custodial center since last Friday after a Muntinlupa court issued an arrest warrant against her on illegal drug charges. President Duterte and his administration accused De Lima, his staunchest critic, of profiting from the illegal drug trade inside the New Bilibid Prison.
