Republican senator of Kentucky Rand Paul took to ABC News recently to discuss a matter that could spell doom for former President Barack Obama.
According to a report by Subject Politics, Paul said that the former commander-in-chief violated the constitution if it is proven that he had spied on Trump’s fired National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn.
“We know one thing for sure: the Obama administration did spy on Flynn,” said the Kentucky representative. “Somebody was reading and taking a transcript of his phone calls and then they released it. It is very important that whoever released that go to jail.”
In addition to this, Paul also suggested that Barack Obama was personally aware of the spying activity.
“There could only be a certain handful of people who did that,” he further said. “I would bring them all in, they would have to take lie detector tests, including the political people. Because some political people knew about this as well.”
Now, in my modest opinion, it is quite impossible to get Obama behind bars. Not as long as he has loyal devotees behind every corner. However, considering the seriousness of the allegation that he spied on Trump’s high-ranking officials (and who knows, maybe even on Trump), it is possible for Obama to be somehow penalized.
I wouldn’t complain. I’ll take what I can get, but as long as Obama is brought before the face of justice and forced to realize that he is neither untouchable, nor above the law.
