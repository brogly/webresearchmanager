UN Ambassador Nikki Haley had some strong words for the United Nations during her trip to Israel this week. She said to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin:
“I HAVE NEVER TAKEN KINDLY TO BULLIES, AND THE UN HAS BULLIED ISRAEL FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN ANYMORE. IT IS A NEW DAY FOR ISRAEL IN THE UNITED NATIONS.”
Earlier this week in Geneva Nikki Haley confirmed that the US was mulling over withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council because of its bias against Israel.
The UN is known for taking a harder line against Israel than literally any other country—just last March the Council on Human Rights adopted 5 resolutions against Israel.
The Bush Administration had suspended its membership in the council for three years for its anti-Israel bias. Obama reentered the council in 2009, and shocked the world when the US voted to abstain during a 2016 vote on a resolution introduced by Egypt condemning Israeli settlements as illegal. Before, the US always voted against such resolutions.
Haley said Washington will make a decision on whether or not to withdraw at the end of this month. Either way, the Trump administration has already improved the US’s relationship with Israel. During Haley’s visit, Netanyahu said during a speech:
“President Trump and you, I think, have changed the discourse, have drawn new standards, and everybody’s taking up, and that’s great.”
He added:
“I think it makes a world of difference, both for Israel and the US. Again, I felt that the UN would collapse, you know, that whole scaffolding of lies would just collapse. I think you’ve put in that simple word – truth.”
The Trump Administration is sticking up for Israel against the bullying UN and creating real change within this organization. Nikki Haley has made it clear: “Israel will no longer be the United Nation’s punching bag.”
