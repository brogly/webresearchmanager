Starting today, rainbow-colored Doritos inspired by the LGBT Pride flag will be available to donors of the It Gets Better Campaign, a nonprofit that seeks to provide hope to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, snack maker Frito-Lay announced today in a news release.
The limited-edition Doritos Rainbows chips will celebrate and support the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community “in the boldest, most colorful way possible,” the release said.
The new product is available exclusively to consumers who donate $10 or more in support to the It Gets Better Project.
Those supporters will be mailed a bag of Doritos Rainbows chips while supplies last.
 
Upon making their donations, consumers are encouraged to share messages of hope and inspiration using #BoldandBetter.
Ram Krishnan, the snack maker’s chief marketing officer, said in the release that Doritos Rainbows would bring “an entirely new product experience to our consumers to show our commitment toward equal rights for the LGBT community and celebrate humanity without exception.”
