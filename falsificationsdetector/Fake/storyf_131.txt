First, Fox News founder Roger Ailes fell victim to sexual harassment charges.
Next, Bill O’Reilly was booted from his show after stunningly similar accusations.
Now, the liberals’ next target is none other than conservative stalwart Sean Hannity, with one former Fox News contributor shouting the same accusations that brought down two media powerhouses.
Among the allegations, Schlussel claims that while at an appearance in Detroit which they both attended, Hannity invited her back to his hotel room.
Schlussel says that after she turned down his advances, she was not invited back on his program.
“This kind of stuff is all over the place at Fox News and anything that has to do with Sean Hannity,” Schlussel said.
At this point, it looks like nothing other than a coordinated attack by the left to bring down the biggest conservative voices on television — and they’ve been successful so far.
