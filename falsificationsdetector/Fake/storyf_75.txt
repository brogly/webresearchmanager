To help cope with the ongoing recovery from Hurricane Hermine, several counties in Florida have been made eligible to receive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Leon County estimates Hermine’s impact cost $8.4 mn, while other neighboring counties also incurred high damage bills from the storm. With public assistance, FEMA reimburses 75% of eligible costs.
