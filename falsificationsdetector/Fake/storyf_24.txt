Trump has got to be tired of the mainstream media and the Democrats attacking him without evidence or facts of any kind.
They started when he announced his candidacy and they have continued after former FBI director James Comey testified saying that he asked a friend to leak the contents of his memos on meetings with President Trump.
But what Comey just announced is that the has no problem leaking information to the press.
President Trump wasn’t scared of his memos at all either and in his response announced that he was “100 willing” to testify on the matter.
The Democrats have been jumping at the bit for this but they haven’t had the chance.
Now they are calling for President Trump to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.
But little do they know they are playing right into Trump’s hands.
What better way to set the record straight than on the record and at the request of the Democrats?
The Democrats are asking for their lies on the Russia investigation to be exposed and that is surely what President Trump will do.
Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) has called on House Judiciary Committee leader Bob Goodlatte to invite President Trump before the panel to testify.
Via The Hill:
“IT IS THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT SHOULD BE THE VENUE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO APPARENT ATTEMPTS AT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IN THE REMOVAL OF MR. COMEY IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE ‘PRESSURE’ THE PRESIDENT WAS FEELING FROM INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO HIS CAMPAIGN’S TIES TO RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN AMERICA’S MOST RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,” GUTIERREZ, A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE, WROTE IN A LETTER TO GOODLATTE.
“THEREFORE, I BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT ON YOU AS CHAIRMAN TO IMMEDIATELY INVITE THE PRESIDENT TO TESTIFY.”
The best part about this is that if the Democrats are the ones calling for Trump to testify they will be the means to their own end.
Trump isn’t guilty otherwise they would have found evidence in the last months but instead they are pushing forward without evidence and wasting tax payer dollars.
