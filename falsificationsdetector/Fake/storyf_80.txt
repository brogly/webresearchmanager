Liberals and their media outlets are no strangers to writing crazy articles to make Hillary Clinton look good. What one magazine wrote has everyone’s jaw dropping.
Cosmopolitan Magazine Says Bill and Hillary Clinton are “Good Marriage Role Models.”
The article’s title is ‘The Clintons and the Reality of a Long Marriage.’ In it, you can read sad attempts to make the case that the Clinton marriage is actually one that everyone should look up to. They have made philandering men a part of the feminist agenda only because we’re talking about one’s wife who was running for president.
Cosmo writer Ada Calhoun reminded us that the Clintons’ 45-year marriage has “outlasted the Gores, the first two Trump marriages, and the first two Gingrich marriages.” Goals, right?
The article additionally attacks divorcees Trump, Giuliani, and Gingrich for all being critical of Hillary standing by her cheating man. The writer seems to think “you should have the ‘decency’ to leave your spouse” if you cheat on them.
But, when it comes to Hillary, she says she “could have put her husband’s recklessness behind her like a bad haircut and moved on to continue her change-making and achievements without him too. But she stayed.” Now, the sweet old couple “get to be doting grandparents together, mutually supporting each other in their latest acts, and potentially becoming the first married to couple to ever both be President, which will make a good Christmas letter.”
It’s shocking what the liberals would say just to defend their own.
