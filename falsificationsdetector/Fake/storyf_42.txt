Former Georgia state Sen. Robert Brown, who led the chamber’s Democrats from 2005 until this year, has been found dead at his home. Macon Police Department spokeswoman Jami Gaudet says the 61-year-old Brown died of a single gunshot wound to the head. Police said it was an apparent suicide. The 19-year senator from Macon was first elected in a special election in 1991 to fill an unexpired term. He was elected Democratic Leader in 2005. He left the Senate this year to launch a failed bid for Macon mayor, finishing third in the Democratic primary in July. Lt. Gov. Casey"
