Former President Barack Obama was among the first set of influential persons to send a congratulatory message to Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant following the team’s championship win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.
However, Obama didn’t compliment the Finals MVP on scoring 30-plus points each game. Instead, he focused on the other end of the floor.
“Congrats, your defense was really good,’ which was random,” Durant told The Ringer’s Bill Simmons when asked what Obama said.
 
Obama also told Durant to “enjoy it, have some fun” following his first title win. Durant told Simmons the most surprising text he got after the victory was from his high-school girlfriend.
 
“The way that he embraced the opportunity in the Finals, it was unbelievable,” Stephen Curry told reporters. “It’s kind of crazy to think about the conversations we had this summer and going into the year about how we can both mesh and do what we do and be the players that we are. And [to]see it come to life in this series, it was unbelievable.”
