This afternoon, Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law a bill to prohibit local governments from moving historical monuments on public property that have been in place for 40 years or more, according to a news release from the bill’s sponsor.
The new law also prohibits renaming buildings and streets with historical names that have been in there for at least 40 years also.
This legislation has been debated by Lawmakers for several years.
The law is not restricted to Confederate monuments.
According to AL, Restrictions also apply to monuments at least 20 years old but less than 40, and streets and schools at least 20 years old but less than 40 that are named after a historical person. Removal or renaming requires approval from a newly created Committee on Alabama Monument Protection. The law outlines the process required to get a waiver from the committee.
This Law is called the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act.
It was proposed by Sen. Gerald Allen, R-Tuscaloosa, He said This:
“I appreciate Gov. Ivey standing up for the thoughtful preservation of Alabama’s history,” Allen said in a press release. “Contrary to what its detractors say, the Memorial Preservation Act is intended to preserve all of Alabama’s history – the good and the bad – so our children and grandchildren can learn from the past to create a better future.”
The bill passed with support from the Republican majority and opposition from most Democrats.
Black Lawmakers argued against the bill, but were outmatched. They argued that it was wrong for Legislature to dictate local communities about monuments that sit on local public property.
“In fact, what it does it says whoever was in power and was able to put their history in monuments, they are protected,” Sen. Hank Sanders, D-Selma, said when the bill passed the Senate in March.
An entity that moves or renames a monument or building without a waiver would be subject to a $25,000 fine as determined by the attorney general, according to the new law.
