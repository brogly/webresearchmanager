Leftist congressman and an anti-Trump whiner, Luis Gutierrez, took almost half of his campaign money and put it in his wife’s pockets, according to his elections filing.
Soraida Gutierrez, the wife of the Illinois Democrat, was a registered lobbyist in Illinois for most of the early 2000s.
She has been on the payroll for the congressman’s campaign for the last seven years, however, she made in hundreds of thousands of dollars while on his payroll.
And the money keeps rolling in.
On Feb. 6, the Gutierrez for Congress campaign gave her $6,000 for her work as their “treasurer” and for “management” and “fundraising” services. Three weeks after the fact, she was given another $6,000.
That might not seem like a lot, but it is, considering it’s almost half of the entire amount the campaign spent during the first quarter or 2017.
All in all, Soraida has been given $385,000 from her husband’s campaign since 2010,
Soraida raked in $44,000 in 2010 and was the top receiver of campaign cash. Mrs. Gutierrez was paid $93,000 during the 2012 cycle from the campaign’s funds, again making her the biggest beneficiary of campaign funds. In 2014, Soraida’s payments jumped to $110,000. Throughout the 2016 election processed, Soraida’s payments raised again as she was paid $125,856 from the campaign.
But it’s not just his wife who benefits from Luis’ supporters. Gutierrez has given his daughter Omaira more than $4,000 and his daughter Jessica another $600.
While most definitely sleazy, this apparently isn’t illegal. Since 2001, members of Congress have been permitted to place family members on their campaign payroll.
Luis Gutierrez is another example of why politicians deserve to go to prison after their terms. It’s absolutely insane that he has gotten away with this. Prison sounds really good for him and his wife.
