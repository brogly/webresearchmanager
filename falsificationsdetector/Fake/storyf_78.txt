President Trump has been patiently waiting to see what comes out of this ridiculous special investigation. By now, it’s clear he did not collude with the Russians to beat Hillary Clinton. He beat her because Americans want to make America great again, prosperous again, and safe again.
However, the liberal media continues to write bad things about Trump. The only thing he did was tweet to the American people who deserved something more than lies and left-distorted half truths. He stood up against these horrendous people &#8211; something not everyone can do.
President Trump speak up again because of yesterday’s incredible leak to the press by Robert Muellers “special council” team. This is what he tweeted:
I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic &amp; jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!

President Trump will continue to do this work and to fulfill all of his campaign promises no matter what lies the liberals spread.
This Robert Muller person is Comey’s best friend and Comey turned out to be a leaker and a traitor. Now Mueller is leaking stuff out. Trump needs to put him in his place, and quick before he spreads more lies!
