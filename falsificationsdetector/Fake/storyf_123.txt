Breitbart released a story on Saturday about our website (undergroundnewsreport.com) that truly embodies journalistic hypocrisy; and even Breitbart readers were having none of it.
The article by Jerome Hudson was titled “Creator of Fake News Website to Donate Ad Revenue to Democrats”.
The author seems to imply that all of the ‘fake news’ articles done on ‘The Underground Report’ are done nihilistically and purely for our amusement and fun.
While it should come at no surprise that a Breitbart writer would lack any semblance of receptivity to greater ideas, he also conveniently left out the fact that we have satire disclaimers plastered on every page of the site.
While it is true that in an interview with ‘Politifact‘ I said that I plan on donating ad revenue earned from the site to the 2020 democratic nominee for president, even Breitbart readers found the hypocritical criticism lame at best.
The top comments on their facebook post of the story read:
 
Another reader points out the hypocricy of Brietbart’s story:
 
This story among many other questionable works of journalism begs the question: Is Breitbart making a run at satire themselves?
