After Tim Allen’s appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel show Hollywood did the unthinkable. In an interview he revealed the brutal truth about the left and now Hollywood is repaying him.
Tim Allen’s sitcom was canceled even though the ratings were high. It’s no secret that Hollywood only cares about money and ratings so there must be something else here.
This is what Allen stated:
“I’m not kidding. You gotta be real careful around here. You get beat up if you don’t believe what everybody believes,” said Allen.
“This is like ‘30s Germany,” he joked. “I don’t know what happened. If you’re not part of the group, ‘You know what we believe is right,’ I go, ‘Well, I might have a problem with that.’”
Allen continued attacking Hollywood on Fox news:
“What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn’t like Trump because he was a bully, but if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump you got bullied for doing that.”
According to Deadline Hollywood, the show “was considered the perfect sitcom for the Trump era, hitting ratings highs in its sixth season.”
“With a central character who is a political conservative and devout Christian adhering to traditional American values, the blue-collar comedy appeals to viewers in the Heartland, a constituency that helped elect Donald Trump as president and has been energized post-election as evidenced by the ratings success of new USA drama Shooter.”
They added:
“With around 6.4 million viewers, Last Man Standing was outperforming other shows winning its 8-8:30 PM time slot.”
This sitcom was consider the perfect for the Trump era, also was cheap to produce and reruns sell well, but that wasn’t enough for Hollywood they want him to think like them or hold his silence.
