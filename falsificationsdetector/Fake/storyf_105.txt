Dr.Ben Carson was as of late gotten some interview about his opinions on Islam and ought to a Muslim be ever responsible for our nation.  Ben Carson gave a damn good answer. Here is his answer:
Let me ask you a question this way?
Should a president’s faith matter?
Should your faith matter to voters?
Ben said: “I guess it depends on what that faith is. If it is inconsistent with the values and principles of those of America, than of course it should matter.But if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the constitution No problem. “
– So do you believe that Islam is consistent with the constitution?
Dr. Ben said: “NO I DO NOT, I do not, I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation, I absolutely would not agree with that.”
