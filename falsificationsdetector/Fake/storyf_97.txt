THERE YOU HAVE IT FOLKS, PROOF, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT, THAT THE ENTIRE MSM IS FULL OF SHIT AND IN THE TANK FOR A GLOBAL CORPORATE TYRANNY.  THIS COUNTRY HAS FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE MOST DEPRAVED AND EVIL AMONG US.  THE DEEP STATE MUST BE STOPPED AT ALL COSTS.  TRUMP IS NOT PERFECT BUT HE WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR AMERICANS, AND THE POWERS THAT BE CAN NOT TOLERATE THAT. 
CONS JOURNAL REPORTS: Thanks to the constant chatter from the mainstream media, we are all well aware by now of the storyline involving Republican officials, then-Senator Jeff Sessions,  Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and the conversations that were had between them leading up to the presidential election.
However, the storyline that is not getting any attention is the one in which the Russian ambassador met with advisers to Hillary’s campaign.  That’s right..Big shocker, I know!
According to the latest from The Hill, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman said in an interview Sunday that the Russian ambassador who met with Trump campaign officials also met with “people working in think tanks advising Hillary or advising people working for Hillary.”
“Well, if you look at some people connected with Hillary Clinton during her campaign, you would probably see that he had lots of meetings of that kind,” Dmitry Peskov told CNN “GPS” host Fareed Zakaria, implying it is the job of Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to meet with officials on both sides to talk about “bilateral relations.”
He also defended said meetings, and suggested interference with the 2016 election was not their intent:
“But there were no meetings about elections — electoral process … So if you look at it with intention to demonize Russia, you would probably say that, yes, he was trying to interfere in Hillary’s activities. But it would be nonsense, because this is not true,” Peskov said.
Peskov also added that Vladimir Putin had never voiced support – at least publicly – for either candidate:
“You would probably recall that President Putin, during election campaign, had never answered directly a question about his candidate of his support. He kept saying that we will respect a choice of American people,” Peskov told Zakaria.
Peskov, did however, concede that Putin preferred Trump over Clinton, saying, “If you ask him whether he had mentioned the then-candidate Donald Trump, I will answer, yes, he had.”
But why, you might ask?…
“The candidate Hillary Clinton was quite negative about our country in her attitude and in her program, declaring Russia being nearly the main evil in the world and the main threat for the United States,” Peskov said.
“And to the contrary, the other candidate, Donald Trump, was saying that, ‘Yes, we disagree with the Russians … in lots of issues, but we have to talk to them in order to try to find some understanding.’ Whom would you like better? The one who says that Russia is evil or the one who says that, ‘Yes, we disagree, but let’s talk to understand and to try to find some points of agreement?’” he asked.
What do you think about this?
