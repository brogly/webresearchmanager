A rude dude got a brutal lesson in the importance of being a gentleman.
It started after a scantily clad woman accused the man of grabbing her butt as she walked along the Las Vegas strip, according to a video shared by Flyheight.com and watched more than a million times on Media Takeout’s Facebook page.
The woman, whose shorts gave new meaning to the word short, got right in the man’s face and started berating him, but he wouldn’t leave.
That’s when one man stepped in and knocked him to his back with one punch.
