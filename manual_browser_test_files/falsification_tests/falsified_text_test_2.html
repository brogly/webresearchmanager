Sean Hannity is the latest target in the liberal witch-hunt on Fox News. Hannity predicted that if Bill Shine was replaced it would be the “end of Fox News Channel as we know it”. Shine did get replaced, now liberals are spreading rumors that Hannity is going to resign. 
“According to 3 Fox sources, Hannity has a “key man clause” in his contract that would allow him to quit anytime. He’s v. loyal to Shine,” wrote NBC’s Gabriel Sherman. 
Sean Hannity is not willing to take it. He gave warnings to everyone after him on twitter. “A lot of time with an army of attorneys. Topics include; libel, slander, defamation, tortious interference. Stay tuned. There is Zero chance they can stop me with lies, attacks, slander defamation, and NOW sabotage. I have a massive army, ALL OVER THIS. SOON!!” wrote Hannity on Twitter. 
Hannity addressed the claims that he was leaving Fox News. He posted an article on Twitter called, “Source: Sean Hannity is ‘Not Negotiating’ for an Exit From Fox News”. Hannity then wrote “If I have anything to say about @FoxNews I will say it tonight at 10 est. All I’ll say now is this is true,”
Then during his show he continued to address the rumors. “By the way, special thank you to all our friends in the media that were tuning in tonight, maybe for the first time. And all the lies you’ve heard about me are not true,” said Hannity.
