Donald Trump has drawn the ire from anyone who values our democratic system by attempting to delegitimize federal judges who blacked his repellent travel ban.
A federal judge in Cleveland, however, struck back by making a bold announcement about Trump’s own legitimacy as President.
Aspiring dictator Trump got into yet more hot water recently when he lashed out at the federal judges who put his thinly-veiled anti-Muslim seven nations travel ban on ice. Tweeted Trump about the Seattle judge who made the initial ruling against the ban, “The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” Trump’s own Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch stuck his neck out and put his own appointment on the line by called Trump’s statements “demoralizing” and “disheartening.”
U.S. District Judge did Gorsuch one further by opining on Trump’s anti-judiciary comments, “I think to say it publicly, that’s his right. But it calls into question, and some might even say forfeits, his or her own legitimacy. So I’ll leave it at that. It’s an important question, but that’s how I feel…I don’t believe there’s a single federal judge who would be intimidated by anybody.We took an oath to support and defend the Constitution and it means a lot. And I think that oath means even more today.” Ouch! Do you think what Trump said forfeited his legitimacy as President?
