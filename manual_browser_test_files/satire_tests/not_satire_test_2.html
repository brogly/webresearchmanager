<h3>Toronto Police Services Board reaches tentative agreements with officers, civilian staff</h3>
<p>The union representing uniformed police officers and civilian staff has reached tentative five-year agreements with the Toronto Police Services Board.

In a news release issued Saturday afternoon, the board confirmed that after two months of collective bargaining, the two sides reached a deal on six agreements representing workers at the service.

Toronto police Chief Mark Saunders argued for an increase to the service’s operating budget last month. On Saturday afternoon, the police board announced it had reached tentative five-year agreements with the union.

“These five-year tentative agreements will be taken to both the association membership and the board for ratification and approval in due course,” the release said.

Details about the agreements will be released at a later date. The agreements must still be ratified by the union’s membership.

The Toronto Police Association represents roughly 8,000 full-time and part-time workers, including police officers, parking enforcement officers and support staff.

The tentative agreements come roughly three weeks after the board unanimously approved a $30 million increase to the service’s operating budget. The budget still has to be approved by city council in March.</p>
