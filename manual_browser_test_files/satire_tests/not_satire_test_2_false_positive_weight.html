Our cookbook of the week is French Appetizers by Québec City-based writer and food stylist Marie Asselin. Over the next two days, we’ll feature another recipe from the book and an interview with its author.To try another recipe from the book, check out: gougères, four ways and spiced madeleines with salted caramel sauce.Marie Asselin devotes a chapter in French Appetizers to savoury cakes and tarts, and this incredibly delicious galette is a standout. The recipe was also a clear winner with her recipe testers, even those who were wary of blue cheese. “This one was always a hit. Everyone came back to me saying, ‘This is outstanding and everybody loved it,’” she says. “It’s a galette with a very complex taste and it’s a very impressive tart to serve as well.”Its layered elements – caramelized onions, blue cheese, pear, arugula and toasted hazelnuts – make for a memorable addition to an apèro (cocktail hour) spread, but it’s equally fitting for an any day lunch or dinner. “It really surprises people to have a savoury tart,” says Asselin, adding that while it’s somewhat unexpected in Canada, the tradition of savoury cakes and tarts is strong in France.“The French really love their savoury cakes and I feel like it’s a fun way because in North America we don’t do savoury cakes that often. But they’re really good. They’re warm and cheesy, and you can put all sorts of savoury things in there.”1 batch Whole-wheat Shortcrust Pastry (recipe follows) 1 tbsp (15 mL) extra virgin olive oil 1 tbsp (15 mL) butter 1 lb (454 g) sweet onions (such as Vidalia), thinly sliced 1/2 tsp (2 mL) kosher salt 1 tbsp (15 mL) water 1 tbsp (15 mL) Dijon mustard About 1 tbsp (15 mL) milk Sea salt flakes, for sprinklingPear and Blue Cheese Topping: 1/2 cup (125 mL) crumbled blue cheese (such as Roquefort; about 57 g), divided 1 lb (454 g) firm pears (such as Anjou or Bosc), cored and sliced 1 large handful arugula, for garnish 1/3 cup (75 mL) coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts, for garnishOn a lightly floured work surface, roll the pastry out to a 15-inch (38-cm) circle. Transfer to a baking sheet (the edges can fold up if the pastry circle doesn’t fit flat into the sheet) and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Heat the olive oil and butter in a skillet set over medium heat. Add the onions, salt, and water; stir to coat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and cook until the onion is very soft, stirring from time to time, about 25 minutes. Uncover, increase the heat to medium high, and cook for 2–3 minutes more, stirring from time to time, to evaporate any leftover liquids. Transfer to a bowl to cool.Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Take the crust out of the refrigerator. Spread with the mustard, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) border all around, and evenly distribute the onion mixture over the top.Sprinkle 1/4 cup (50 mL) of the cheese over the onion. Top with the pear slices, fanning them in circles. Bring the edges of the dough up and over the filling, creasing it and gently pressing it down onto the filling as you go. Brush the dough with milk and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for 5 minutes more, or until the crust is golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack for 10 minutes. Garnish with arugula and hazelnuts and serve.1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter, chilled 1 cup (250 mL) all-purpose flour 1/2 cup (125 mL) whole-wheat flour 1/4 tsp (1 mL) kosher salt 1 egg 2 tbsp (30 mL) ice waterCut the butter into small cubes and place on a small plate. Freeze for 20 minutes.Food processor method: Pulse the flour and salt together. Add the butter and process for 10 continuous seconds, until the mixture looks like coarse breadcrumbs. Add the egg and process for 5 seconds. Add the ice water and process for 20 seconds. The dough should now start clumping together. Turn the mixture out onto a work surface. The mixture will be grainy but should hold together when pressed. Using your hands, gather the dough into a ball then flatten into a disk, kneading it as lightly as possible.Hand method: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add the butter and the egg, cutting into the flour using a pastry cutter or your hands until the mixture has a pea-like consistency. Drizzle in the water and continue cutting just to combine. Gather the dough into a ball then flatten into a disk, kneading it as lightly as possible.Roll out the dough as needed (see note), or wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the dough for up to 1 month, wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in a freezer bag.Note: It’s easier to roll out dough just after it has been mixed together, as opposed to rolling it after refrigeration. If you’re making shortcrust pastry right before you need to use it, gather it into a disk, set it on a lightly floured surface, and roll it out to the required size. Transfer to a baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour. Use as instructed by the recipe.Excerpted from French Appetizers by Marie Asselin, reprinted by permission of Gibbs Smith.
